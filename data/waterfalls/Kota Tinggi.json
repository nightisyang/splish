  "description": "Over-commercialised waterfall playground in resort style.As the waterfall (also known as Lombong fall) is so near to Singapore, it will be crowded on weekends and during school holidays.After the souvenir shops, the cafe and the crowds, the actual cascades and waterfall come as a pleasant surpriseWhen you appreciate the isolated character of many Malaysian falls, you may be disappointed by the 'Sunway Lagoon' aspect of Kota Tinggi. But if you close your eyes for the crowds and the many \"Don't do this\" and \"Don't do that\" signs, it still can be a rewarding experience. The top waterfall. Although the picture looks quiet, actually there is a big crowd around here.Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous ! Always take care about your safetyVisitor Comments",
