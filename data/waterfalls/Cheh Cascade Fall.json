{"name":"Cheh Cascade Fall","description":"Cheh cascade fall is a roadside fall at the entrance of a campsite resort. The water quality is average with a small pool formed by \"human landscaping\".Head to Sekolah Menengah Sains Hulu Selangor as the landmark. Take the junction in going along the school wall border.() Proceed along the road till you reach a small bridge with parking spots nearby by the side of the road. The cascade fall is visible from the bridge area.We attempted to explore upriver but did not find the access inviting. There is another cascade fall at the end of the resort borders.Image 1\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ","state":"Selangor","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"3.40594, 101.65883","verbatimLatitude":"3.40594","verbatimLongitude":"101.65883","decimalLatitude":3.40594,"decimalLongitude":101.65883,"decimalCoordinates":"3.40594,101.65883"},"coordinates":"3.40594, 101.65883","waterSource":"Sg.
