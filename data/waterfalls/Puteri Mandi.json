{"name":"Puteri Mandi","description":"The west slope of Gunung Jerai has a number of (seasonal) waterfalls. Three of them can be reached from Yan. Just outside Yan a signboard leads the way to Recreation Park Titit Hayun, where Puteri Mandi, the Bath of the Princess is located.We followed the trail until a delapidated engine room. Back at the main entrance of the park we were told that the real Puteri Mandi is still further, about 1 km. This has to be explored another time, during the rainy season.","state":"Kedah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N05 47.54' E100 24.75'","verbatimLatitude":"N05 47.54'","verbatimLongitude":"E100 24.75'","decimalLatitude":5.79233,"decimalLongitude":100.4125,"decimalCoordinates":"5.79233,100.4125"},"coordinates":"N05 47.54'  E100 24.75'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"unknown","accessibility":"Trekking along trail","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNputerimandi01.JPG","TNputerimandi02.JPG","TNputerimandi03.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/92puterimandi/tn/TNputerimandi01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/92puterimandi/tn/TNputerimandi02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/92puterimandi/tn/TNputerimandi03.JPG"],"imgDesc":["In the park you can climb Gunung Jerai, or you can walk to the waterfall","During our visit there was only little water in the stream","Mini waterfalls"],"imgFullResFilename":["puterimandi03.JPG","puterimandi02.JPG","gunungjerai00.gif","puterimandi01.JPG"]},"url":"92puterimandi.php"}
