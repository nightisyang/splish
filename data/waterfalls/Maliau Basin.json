{"name":"Maliau Basin","description":"The Maliau basin is sometimes called \"The Lost World of Sabah\". It was discovered in 1947 from the air, but it was only in 1988 that a first expedition visited the region. Until now only 30 % of the basin has been explored. Trekking in this part of Sabah is a serious adventure. You need permission from the Yayasan Sabah and a guide. But it is worth the effort, unspoilt nature and beautiful waterfalls will be your reward.A trip to the Maliau Basin takes several days, you will stay overnight in a number of camps and you must be prepared for long jungle treks under sometimes difficult conditions. For detailed information, download this Maliau trip report, prepared by Gabriel Chong.The powerful Giluk fall can be reached from the Camel Trophy CampThe largest and most famous falls in the area are the Maliau Falls. In total, it has seven tiers but you only see the 5th & 6th tier from the ground. They can be reached by a 1.5 hour trek from the Lobah CampTwo more falls in the region are the Giluk fall and the Sabender Fall. The Giluk fall can be combined with the Takob-Akob fall, whereas the Sabender fall is a 1 hour trek from Ginseng Camp.A well deserved shower under Sabendar Falls after a long trekkingThe pictures on this page are courtesy of Gabriel Chong, the Chin Family, Stefan Kolb and Lau Nai Kwong.
