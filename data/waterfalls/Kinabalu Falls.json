{"name":"Kinabalu Falls","description":"The Kinabalu National Park is of course famous for the Gunung Kinabalu, the pitcher plants and the bird life. But there are waterfalls too! Many of them will never have been visited, because there is no access. However, a few are accesible. When you start climbing to Gunung Kinabalu, after passing the Timpohon gate, you will pass the Carson Fall. The waterfall is not spectacular but the location is scenic and you can fill your water bottles here. After climbing the mountain, many people spend a night at the Poring Hot Springs Resort to relax. This is still part of the large Kinabalu National Park (754 square kilometers!)It is only a short walk from the hot springs to an attractive waterfall, the Kipungit Fall. You can take a refreshing bath here. When you continue the trail, you will reach the Langanan Fall, but we had no time to visit this fall.A contribution from Hamidi Mohd Noh. From the Kipungit fall a clear trail leads in about 1 hour and 45 minutes to the Langanan Fall. The clearly signposted trail is steep uphill and can be slippery after rain. Nice views. The Langanan waterfall is a tall and powerful fall.From the Timpohon Gate, another tall \"ribbon\" fall is visible, far away. Also visible from the Tamparuli - Ranau road. This is the Kadamaian Fall. Not yet visited by us, access will not be easy, the starting point is Kg Kiau, where you have to find a guide.","state":"Sabah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N6 01.88' E116 32.84'","verbatimLatitude":"N6 01.88'","verbatimLongitude":"E116 32.84'","decimalLatitude":6.03133,"decimalLongitude":116.54733,"decimalCoordinates":"6.03133,116.54733"},"coordinates":"N6 01.88' E116 32.84'  and N6 02.98' E116 42.36'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Vertical Falls","accessibility":"Trekking, Swimming","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNkinabalu01.JPG","TNkinabalu02.JPG","TNkinabalu03.JPG","TNkinabalu04.JPG","TNkinabalu05.jpg","TNkinabalu06.jpg","TNkinabalu07.jpg","TNkinabalu08.jpg","TNkinabalu09.jpg","TNDSCN2747-1.JPG","TNDSCN2770-1.JPG","TNDSCN2762-1.JPG","TNPB266245.jpg","TNPB266282.jpg","TNkadamaian.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu05.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu06.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu07.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu08.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkinabalu09.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNDSCN2747-1.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNDSCN2770-1.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNDSCN2762-1.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNPB266245.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNPB266282.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/112kinabalu/tn/TNkadamaian.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The headquarters of Kinabalu National Park","Timpohon Gate can look very grim, when it is misty or rainy weather.","Not far from the gate you will pass the Carson Fall","The Carson Fall","Chalets in the Poring Hot Springs Resort","The Hot Springs are a perfect place to soak your tired limbs, after the strenuous climb of Kinabalu Mountain","Signboard to the waterfalls","After a short walk you reach the first waterfall.","The Kipungit waterfall","Update November 2008","View from the trail","Clearly signposted","The Langanan Fall","Update December 2011, contributed by Faye","Gunung Kinabalu.
