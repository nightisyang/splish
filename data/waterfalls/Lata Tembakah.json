{"name":"Lata Tembakah","description":"The Tembakah Waterfalls are probably the most impressive falls of Terengganu. The Hutan Lipur Lata Tembakah is clearly signposted and can be reached from Jertih. Coming from K. Terengganu a shortcut is possible by taking the T142 near Kg JabiThe first waterfalls are actually more like cascades. They have nice, large pools, which make them perfect for family outings. Not surprisingly, this park can be crowded!Our visit took place on a weekday, so at first we were surprised by the number of visitors. Then it became clear that nearby Kelantan was celebrating the sultan's holiday!When you follow the trail along the river, you reach the main fall of the park. It is number 4 of the list.To reach the upper falls, there are two possibities. First, you can choose the jungle trail, which is clearly signposted. The other way is to scramble upwards at the right side of the main fall. Interesting but not easy.The upper falls are also very impressive and as it takes some effort to reach them, they will be quiet even when there is a crowd.The last waterfallArchived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
