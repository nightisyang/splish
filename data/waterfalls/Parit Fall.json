{"name":"Parit Fall","description":"Parit FallFrom both sides of the trail, the fall can be reached in less than half an hour. As the stream collects quite a lot of rubbish, the fall can not be called a pristine one, but the location itself is attractive. There is a small pool, but because of this rubbish, it does not really invite to take a bath...To take a picture like this, you must carefully avoid the rubbish around..Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
