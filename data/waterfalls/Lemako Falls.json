{"name":"Lemako Falls","description":"The most famous waterfall in the Endau Rompin National Park is Buaya Sangkut, but there are many more. When you take the main entrance intof the park, the road crosses a small river, about 10 km before Kg Peta. This is the Sungei Lemako. Take the small dirt road just after the crossing and park your car after a few hundred meter. You will find a trail going down to the river, which you have to cross. Following the left bank of the river you will arrive at the first series of waterfalls, Takah ChapaNear the waterfalls the Orang Asli family of Pak Buyin maintains a jungle camp, where groups can stay overnight. A perfect location to enjoy the beauty of nature.Takah (meaning waterfall) Chapa is a mixture of waterfalls and cascades in several tiers. In the upper level the river splits in two streamsYou can continue after the top of the waterfalls, keeping the right bank of the river. It is advisable to use a guide. The river flows very quietly here, and there are many trails you can follow. After about 45 minutes you will reach a second set of waterfalls, This second set of falls and cascades is also very attractive. A huge pool is perfect for swimming. Apparently there is even a third set of falls, further upstream, but we had no time to explore.Takah PumungPowerful fallsCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
