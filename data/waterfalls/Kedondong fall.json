{"name":"Kedondong fall","description":"The recreation park of the Kedongdong river is located alongside the road from Batang Kali to Gohtong Jaya in the genting Highlands. It is quite basic, with some stalls, a popular place during the weekends for family picnics. The river water is clean and there are beautiful cascades.Not many people know that there is also a nice waterfall upstream of the park, less that one hour trekking away. From the car park there are steps down to the river and you will find that a rather vague trail starts there. Follow this trail or the river bed.  make the river trekking interesting but also sometimes difficult.Huge bouldersThe waterfall comes as a reward with a huge pool. Unspoiled, beautiful jungle environment. You can continue the trail to the top of the fall, where you will find a second, smaller tier.Upper tier of KedongdongThere might be more waterfalls further upstream. We followed the river for another hour, but the trekking became more and more difficult. Maybe the local Orang Asli could help.Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
