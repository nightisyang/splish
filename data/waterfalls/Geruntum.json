Take left, just before a river crossing. Follow the road for about three km. You will reach a few stalls, where you can park your car.When you take the trail inside the jungle, you will soon reach the lower waterfall. To reach the upper tiers, you must cross the stream and climb up at the right side of the fall.During our visit local fishermen were busy catching fish in the turbulent water. And guides from a nearby eco-resort were preparing an abseiling exercise.Preparing an abseil exerciseCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
