{"name":"Tibang Fall","description":"The Slim river is a major tributary of the Bernam river, with its origins in the main Titiwangsa Range. It has a reputation for wild water rafting. And there is a waterfall, which can only be reached by a 4WD. To reach this waterfall, take the Slim River exit from the N-S highway and follow the signs to Kg Slim. From here follow the road to the desolate Ulu Slim Hot Springs. Here the tar road ends. Gradually the condition of the road becomes worse and a 4WD is needed.Not only the road conditions gets worse, also there is a confusing number of junctions and forks. Luckily every now and then you will meet Orang Asli who can show you the way to Kg Tibang. Because that is the Orang Asli kampung from where you can reach the waterfall.Finally... Pos TibangIn the kampung we met friendly Orang Asli, who were willing to guide us further. We could continue for a short distance by car, then we really had to walk and fight the many leeches.The Tibang fall is a vertical fall, not very tall, but unspoilt and peaceful. The falling water forms a nice pool, inviting for a swim. Not easy to reach this fall, but worth the effortNice swimmingpoolCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
