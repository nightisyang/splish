{"name":"Lolo falls","description":"When you follow the road from Ulu Langat north until the end, you will reach Pangsun and the Ranger station for Gunung Nuang, where you have to register. You follow the road to Gunung Nuang until you see a trail to the right with a yellow signboard. Follow this trail, in the beginning it is wide and clear, later you have to follow the yellow ribbon markers.After about one hour trekking you reach the Lolo river. Keep following the markers, a few times you have to cross the river. About half an hour later you arrive at the Bomoh Ali fall, with a nice big pool. A rope hangs down from a tree, so you can play Tarzan..:-)The trail continues, you have to climb a steep slope with the help of a rope. A few hundred meters further you can hear the Berembun fall, but it is not yet visible. You have to swim, climb slippery rocks, then you will find it around the corner. This is not a place to be when there is a risk of flash floods!The Berembun waterfallAfter Berembun the trail goes on and soon you reach the junction with the Gunung Nuang trail. From here it is an easy walk back (about two hours) to the ranger station. Archived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
