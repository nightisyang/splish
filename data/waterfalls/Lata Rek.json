{"name":"Lata Rek","description":"Lata Rek is more a cascade than a waterfall. But a very powerful cascade over the full river width of about 100 meter. The impression of the site will depend strongly on the amount of waterDuring our visit there was a lot of water and as a result the cascades were very impressive. It is possible to climb the cascades, but you have to be very careful. When you loose your balance and fall in the turbulent water, you will not survive it.The cascades are a part of a Mini Hydro Power station (now derelict).Above the cascades there is a derelict water catchment. All is quiet hereArchived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous ! Always take care about your safetyVisitor Comments","state":"Kelantan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N05° 18.67' E102° 17.97'","verbatimLatitude":"N05° 18.67'","verbatimLongitude":"E102° 17.97'","decimalLatitude":5.31117,"decimalLongitude":102.2995,"decimalCoordinates":"5.31117,102.2995"},"coordinates":"N05° 18.67'  E102° 17.97'","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Cascades","accessibility":"Reachable by car","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNrek01.JPG","TNrek02.JPG","TNrek03.JPG","TNrek04.JPG","TNrek05.JPG","TNrek06.JPG","TNrek07.JPG","TNrek08.JPG","TNrek09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/34rek/tn/TNrek09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["A clear sign leads the way from the G.
