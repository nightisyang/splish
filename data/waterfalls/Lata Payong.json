{"name":"Lata Payong","description":"The Bintang mountains, West of the main Titiwangsa range, have quite a number of waterfalls, for example Perahu and Kekabu. In between these two falls there is a relatively unknown waterfall, Lata Payung. Access is from the Kuala Kangsar-Grik road (76). Take care, coming from the South, to take the old 76 road at kg Ngor.Near Kg Kuak you turn left into small road (coordinates N4 59.70 E100 55.92) leading to a small kampung where you can park your car. It is advisable to ask for directions here, or take a guide, as the trail forks several times passing the village gardens.It is not a long hike until you enter the jungle and reach the river. This river has actually three falls, first you will reach the Bayas fall. From there keeping the river to your left, you will reach Lata Payung after a few hundred meters. The fall is quite tall and impressive. Not a big pool, but you can take a refreshing bath and shower. It is possible to climb to the top of the fall, at the left side of the river. Careful, the rocks can be slippery. From the top you are rewarded with a nice view of Lake Cenderoh, deep down.There is a third fall, not yet visited by us","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N 05 0.553' E 100 55.255'","verbatimLatitude":"N 05 0.553'","verbatimLongitude":"E 100 55.255'","decimalLatitude":5.00922,"decimalLongitude":100.92092,"decimalCoordinates":"5.00922,100.92092"},"coordinates":"N 05 0.553'  E 100 55.255'","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical falls","accessibility":"Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNDSC_4021.JPG","TNDSC_4022.JPG","TNIMG_5968.JPG","TNDSC_4026.JPG","TNIMG_5917.JPG","TNDSC_4043.JPG","TNDSC_4051.JPG","TNIMG_5932.JPG","TNDSC_4065.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4021.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4022.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNIMG_5968.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4026.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNIMG_5917.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4043.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4051.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNIMG_5932.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/166payong/tn/TNDSC_4065.JPG"],"imgDesc":["House in the kampung","Trail head","First through plantations","Following the stream","The Bayas fall","Climbing up","Lata Payong","Upper part of the fall","View of lake Cenderoh from the top"],"imgFullResFilename":["DSC_4043.JPG","Map.JPG","DSC_4051.JPG","DSC_4021.JPG","IMG_5968.JPG","DSC_4022.JPG","DSC_4026.JPG","IMG_5917.JPG","DSC_4065.JPG","IMG_5932.JPG"]},"url":"166payong.php"}
