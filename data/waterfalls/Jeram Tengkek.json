{"name":"Jeram Tengkek","description":"To reach the  Recreational Forest, you take the road nr 9 from Kuala Pilah until Batu Kikir. Follow the N19 and later the N124, until you reach the small Kg Tengkek. Drive carefully on this country road, because you share the road with large amounts of cattle! Follow the signs to the Hutal Lipur and you will soon reach the entrace gate and the parking. The park looked well-maintained, there are campsites and chalets can be rented.From the parking, a cemented path along the river brings you to the fall, passing some shelters. You cross the stream on a bridge amd may be surprised why there is no railing. Until you see the remnants of the railing in the water, a telltale sign that this quiet stream can become a dangerous river after a heavy downpour!Although the park looked well-maintained, it was clear that in some places urgent repair was needed. A not unusual feature of Nature Parks in (Peninsular) Malaysia...! After a walk of a few hundred meters you arrive at the fall. Not a big fall, but attractive.Not a big pool, more for wading than for swimming. It is possible to continue the trail, upstream of the fall. It leads to a small reservoir.
