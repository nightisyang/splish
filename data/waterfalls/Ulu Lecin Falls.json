{"name":"Ulu Lecin Falls","description":"Five km north of the small town of Beruas, you will find Hutan Lipur Ulu Licin, on the southern slopes of the Bubu range. A nice stream, but no waterfalls. About 2 km before you reach this Park, in a curve of the road, a minor road to the right leads in a few hundred meters to the first tier of the Ulu Licin falls. Not very impressive, people come here to wash their car or have a drink.Just before you read this first tier, a trail starts too the right that will bring you in a few minutes to the second tier, an interesting curtain fall. Really a nice place to spend some time.From here, the trail is less clear and some scrambling will be required. Your reward will be two more tiers.","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N4 31.50 E100 47.00","verbatimLatitude":"N4 31.50","verbatimLongitude":"E100 47.00","decimalLatitude":4.525,"decimalLongitude":100.78333,"decimalCoordinates":"4.525,100.78333"},"coordinates":"N4 31.50 E100 47.00","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Curtain fall","accessibility":"Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_5326.JPG","TNIMG_5327.JPG","TNIMG_5332.JPG","TNIMG_5384.JPG","TNIMG_5333.JPG","TNIMG_5336.JPG","TNIMG_5342.JPG","TNIMG_5354.JPG","TNIMG_5364.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5326.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5327.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5332.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5384.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5333.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5336.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5342.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5354.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/165ululecin/tn/TNIMG_5364.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The Ulu Licin Hutan Lipur","The waterfalls are NOT here","The first tier, not very interesting ","The trail starts here to the right.
