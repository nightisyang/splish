You start from Kg Pertak and cross the Sg Luit on a ramshackle bridge. A few hundred meter after this crossing there is a fork, where you keep left. The right trail leads to Bukit Kutu. Not far after this fork you can hear a waterfall.This is , reachable via a short side trailLata JebusThe trail continues until a second fork where you keep left again, the right fork leads to Lata Medang. The trail is clear and follows the Luit river,until you reach a Lubuk with a nice pool. If you are adventurous you can trek the river from here, but there is also a recent trail.Following the trail you could easily miss the next waterfall, not large, but beautiful. Finally the trail reaches Lata Makau. A real beauty. An Olympic size pool invites for a refreshing bath.When you scramble up the slope to the right side of the fall, you can reach the next fall, around the corner.
