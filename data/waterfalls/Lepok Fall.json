Leaving KL and the traffic jams behind, the forest of Hulu Langat is a pleasant surprise. The small village of Hulu Langat is a good place for breakfast, before continuing to Pangsun.Just before reaching this Kampung, turn left to Lepok. This small road ends after a few km at a place where you can park your car. From here you cross a stream and start walking. This is a region of Durian orchards and bamboo forest","The trek is going uphill all the time but not in a strenuous way. Pleasant forest and ginger flowers abound here.It will take about two hours to cover the 4 km to the fall, with a 350 meter gain in altitude. Generally the track is clear, don't take the sidetracks which end in Durian farmsWhen you reach a disused water pipeline, you know that you are on the right way. ","The track follows more or less the pipeline until a water catchment basin is reached.From here it is not far to the waterfall"," It is a very attractive waterfall, with a deep pool for swimming. In nice unspoiled jungle surroundings.A perfect target for a daytrip"],"imgFullResFilename":["lepok04.JPG","lepok02.JPG","lepok00.gif","lepok06.JPG","lepok03.JPG","lepok09.JPG","lepok07.JPG","lepok10.JPG","lepok08.JPG","lepok05.JPG"]},"url":"83lepok.php"}
