{"name":"Badak Fall","description":"Hutan Lipur Sungai Badak is also known as Hutan Lipur Batu Hampar. Use trunk road no.1 from Gurun town towards the north, and turn into road no. K605. Drive till the end of the road. Not many locals know about this place since it is an abandoned park.Soon the dirt road becomes a single track, laid along the Sungai Badak. Just follow it towards the upper stream. After about 15 min walking , you will enter the Hutan Lipur Sungai Badak.Just walk on the rock slope, the waterfall is not too far away.The waterfall itself is not spectacular, but the surroundings are very scenicContributed by team member Faye","state":"Kedah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N5 49.323 E100 27.65","verbatimLatitude":"N5 49.323","verbatimLongitude":"E100 27.65","decimalLatitude":5.82205,"decimalLongitude":100.46083,"decimalCoordinates":"5.82205,100.46083"},"coordinates":"N5 49.323 E100 27.65","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Cascade, stream","accessibility":"Trekking (Easy)","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNPB120310.jpg","TNPB120305.jpg","TNPB120249.jpg","TNPB120251.jpg","TNPB120252.jpg","TNPB120253.jpg","TNPB120260.jpg","TNPB120264.jpg","TNPB120266.jpg","TNPB120285.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120310.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120305.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120249.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120251.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120252.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120253.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120260.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120264.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120266.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/167badak/tn/TNPB120285.jpg"],"imgDesc":["A signboard for homestay Kpg.
