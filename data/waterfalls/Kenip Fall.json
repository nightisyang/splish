{"name":"Kenip Fall","description":"There must be many waterfalls in Malaysia that are only known to a few locals. Probably the waterfalls of Sungei Kenip belong to this group. This river has its origin on the slopes of the Main Range and joins the Jelai River. In this Orang Asli country you will need a guide to find this waterfall. First you have to use a logging road, which might cause problems in rainy weather.After trekking for about one hour on a sometimes overgrown trail, you reach the fall. According to our guide there are more falls upstream, but we had no time to explore them, as the weather was not reliable.Our guide told us that there are several more waterfalls to explore in the surroundings. When the new highway to the Cameron Highlands will be finished, access to this remote region will become easier.","state":"Pahang","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N04 15.04' E101 37.55'","verbatimLatitude":"N04 15.04'","verbatimLongitude":"E101 37.55'","decimalLatitude":4.25067,"decimalLongitude":101.62583,"decimalCoordinates":"4.25067,101.62583"},"coordinates":"N04 15.04'  E101 37.55'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Waterfall and cascades","accessibility":"4WD and trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNkenip01.JPG","TNkenip02.JPG","TNkenip03.JPG","TNkenip04.JPG","TNkenip05.JPG","TNkenip06.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/105kenip/tn/TNkenip06.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Without a guide you would never find the trail head...","On our way to the fall we passed magnificent bamboo groves","A few times you have to cross small streams","The Kenip fall, completely unspoilt.
