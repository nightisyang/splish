{"name":"Lata Seru","description":"Bukit Kundur, with an altitude of 550 meter, is more a hill than a mountain, but still it supports at least two waterfalls. On the southern slope you will find the Penitih falls and on the eastern slope the Seru fall. To reach the fall, you follow the coastal road nr 3 until Kemasik, there you take the T13, after a few km turn right into T129. Look for a signboard to Hutan Lipur Air Menderu. A tar road leads to a well maintained park with shelters and a campsite. A cemented path leads into the forest. You pass cascades and pools, suitable for families, but on weekdays you may be the only visitor. The path ends at a small waterfall with a shallow pool.From the lower fall, you will have to find your own way upstream. Only vague traces of a trail. The stream has cut its way in a steep gorge. In about 45 minutes you will reach . Pristine, not many visitors will venture this far. Vertical fall with a nice big pool.Lata Seru","state":"Terengganu","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N 04 29.02' E103 22.58'","verbatimLatitude":"N 04","verbatimLongitude":"29.02' E103 22.58'","decimalLatitude":4.48367,"decimalLongitude":103.37633,"decimalCoordinates":"4.48367,103.37633"},"coordinates":"N 04 29.02'  E103 22.58'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Vertical","accessibility":"Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_3634.JPG","TNIMG_3593.JPG","TNIMG_3633.JPG","TNIMG_3596.JPG","TNIMG_3597.JPG","TNIMG_3598.JPG","TNIMG_3623.JPG","TNIMG_3602.JPG","TNIMG_3604.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3634.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3593.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3633.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3596.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3597.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3598.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3623.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3602.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/160seru/tn/TNIMG_3604.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Take this road to the park","Entrance of the park","Well maintained","The campsite","The path to the lower fall","The lower fall","River trekking to upper fall","Lata Seru","With a nice, big pool"],"imgFullResFilename":["IMG_3593.JPG","IMG_3633.JPG","IMG_3597.JPG","seru00.JPG","IMG_3602.JPG","IMG_3598.JPG","IMG_3604.JPG","IMG_3623.JPG","IMG_3634.JPG","IMG_3596.JPG"]},"url":"160seru.php"}
