It is very famous with birders for its variety of birdlife. To reach Fraser's Hill, either travel via Rawang and Kuala Kubu Baharu, or via Bentong. The access road from the Gap Resthouse is narrow and traffic is restricted. The odd hours for ascending traffic and the even hours for descending traffic. After arrival in Fraser's Hill follow the signs to the Jeriau Fall","Do not expect unspoiled nature here. This is a landscaped park with shelters and a playground, all connected by a cemented walkway. Very suitable for families with children. At first sight it even looks a bit artificial","In the picture at the left it can be seen that even the waterfall has been landscaped! Probably to make a kind of swimming pool, which has been silted so much that it is not more than a wading pool now.But at the back of all these man-made constructions there is a real waterfall!"],"imgFullResFilename":["jeriau02.JPG","jeriau03.JPG","jeriau06.JPG","jeriau04.JPG","jeriau08.JPG","jeriau01.jpg","jeriau00.gif","jeriau05.JPG","jeriau07.JPG"]},"url":"56jeriau.php"}
