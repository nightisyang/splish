{"name":"Bukit Apeh","description":"This must be the nearest waterfall to Kuala Lumpur. Here, in the outskirts of town, a local group of enthusiasts have created a maze of trails in the hilly region of Bukit Apeh. A popular destination for jogging, it can be crowded here, especially during weekends. The trails are maintained very well. Because some visitors misbehaved, the original access from Taman Wangsa has been closed. A new trail has been opened from Taman Saga in Ampang. The first part of the trail is quite steep, until Bukit Saga. From there it is more level, you pass the top of the hill, where a sign guides you to the waterfalls.When you continue after reaching the top of the hill, the trail stays level for a while and finaly slopes down steeply to a nice small waterfall.This waterfall is a nice reward after a quite strenuous walk. It will be interesting to see if it is possible to follow the stream down into the Ulu Langat Valley. The distance to the nearest road is about 1 km, as the crow flies. Altitude difference about 200 mOr in the waterThe old version of this pageCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
