{"name":"Serendah Fall","description":"To reach the Serendah Falls, you take the trunk road nr 1 from Rawang north. Just before reaching Serendah, you turn right to Kg Dato Harun. During our visit the sign boards to the fall were still missing, so you may have to ask the locals for directions. It is about 6 km to the main fall. The road to the fall leads through cultivated farmland. Until recently the fall was relatively unknown. But during our visit in 2003 the first signs were visible that this might change. Apparently it had been decided that the place should be \"developed\"Our visit in april 2005 shows the damage that has been done. The fall has become almost invisble with the massive construction of shelters, walkways, etc. A desolate and spoilt waterfall.Archived page avalaibleCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
