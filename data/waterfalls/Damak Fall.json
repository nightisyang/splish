{"name":"Damak Fall","description":"Ulu Geroh is famous as a place where Rafflesia's grow and where you you can find many Raja Brookes butterflies. There is also a small, but attractive waterfall. To reach Ulu Geroh, you follow the trunk road nr 1 from Ipoh south to the small village of Gopeng. From here a small road passes under the Highway and follows the river for about 10 km to the Orang Asli Kampung of Ulu Geroh.In cooperation with the Malaysian Nature, Society Orang Asli have received a training to guide visitors to the various places of interests. The waterfall can be found easily without a guide, but it might be a good idea to support the local population. Rates however are very steep. Follow the road until the end, from where a clear trail brings you in about half a km to the fall.The trail ends at a nice, attractive waterfall with a shallow pool. Unspoilt environment, no rubbish at all. Keep it that way!","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N04 26.35' E101 15.86'","verbatimLatitude":"N04 26.35'","verbatimLongitude":"E101 15.86'","decimalLatitude":4.43917,"decimalLongitude":101.26433,"decimalCoordinates":"4.43917,101.26433"},"coordinates":"N04 26.35'  E101 15.86'","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Vertical Fall","accessibility":"Car &Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNdamak01.JPG","TNdamak02.JPG","TNdamak03.JPG","TNdamak04.JPG","TNdamak05.JPG","TNdamak06.JPG","TNdamak07.JPG","TNdamak08.JPG","TNdamak09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/97damak/tn/TNdamak09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The road inland is good enough for normal cars","Orang Asli houses in the spread-out village of Ulu Geroh","Many beautiful Raja Brookes butterflies can be found here.","To visit the places where Rafflesia's bloom (here a bud) you really need a guide.","For the last part the trail follows the river.","A mixture of rapids and cascades"],"imgFullResFilename":["damak01.JPG","damak02.JPG","damak06.JPG","damak08.JPG","damak03.JPG","damak09.JPG","damak00.gif","damak05.JPG","damak04.JPG","damak07.JPG"]},"url":"97damak.php"}
