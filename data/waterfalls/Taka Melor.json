{"name":"Taka Melor","description":" is located in Kampung Tenang,near the town of Labis in Segamat,Johor.To get here,follow the route N-S Highway,exit Yong Peng (S) or (U) and follow the sign to Yong Peng and then Labis.The signboard Kg.Tenang is very well marked and you wont miss it. Another name for this village is Pekan Ayer Panas as there is a ‘Hot Spring’ located in here as well. Get ready to turn right once you see the Muslim cemetery on the left,which also houses the shrine of Tok Tenang,the founder of this village.Th stream has one attractive, single fall , and a pool that is really inviting for a swim Taka MelorIt is possible to climb to the top of the fall, but be careful, the rocks can be slippery. It is very serene,pristine and quiet on top. Not sure if there is any 2nd tier falls on top as there is no trek marking, the only way is to follow the stream.Upstream of the waterfallCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
