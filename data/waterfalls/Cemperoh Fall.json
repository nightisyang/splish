{"name":"Cemperoh Fall","description":"The picturesque kampung Janda Baik is located less than one hour away from metropolis KL. It is a popular destination for the townsfolk during weekends. Not many of them know that an attractive waterfall can be found in this region, up the slopes of Gunung Nuang. To go there, you take the highway exit to Janda Baik and drive all the way up the valley.To find the correct route, please study the GPS-map carefully. Where the farmroad ends and the jungle starts, look for a small trail to your left through the grass. The trail, although quite overgrown, is remarkably clear.The jungle trail continues for another 1.5 km, gradually going uphill. We needed a parang, so progress was slow. Only at the end, we could hear the sound of rushing water.The reward for all the hard work is a very nice powerful waterfall, in the middle of a pristine jungle.Lunchtime before going backThe trail seemed to end here, and it is still far to the top of G. Nuang. We have given the fall the name Cemperoh Fall, there might be a local name for the fall. There might be even more falls in the region, still waiting to be discovered.Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
