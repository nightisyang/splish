{"name":"Tebing Tinggi","description":"A beautiful mountain road cuts across the Bintang range from Lenggong in Perak to Selama in Kedah. This road gives access to two waterfalls. The Lata Puteh fall is not easy to access, but the Tebing Tinggi is just beside the road. A cemented footpath leads down to an area with some shelters, form which it is a short trek to the fall. Even during the weekend it will not be crowded here, as only locals know about this remote place.Helicopter view of the Tebing Tinggi fallArchived page available","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N05° 09.59' E100° 53.72'","verbatimLatitude":"N05° 09.59'","verbatimLongitude":"E100° 53.72'","decimalLatitude":5.15983,"decimalLongitude":100.89533,"decimalCoordinates":"5.15983,100.89533"},"coordinates":"N05° 09.59'  E100° 53.72'","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Cascades, Vertical Fall","accessibility":"From Carpark","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNtebingtinggi01.JPG","TNtebingtinggi02.JPG","TNtebingtinggi03.JPG","TNtebingtinggi04.JPG","TNtebingtinggi05.JPG","TNtebingtinggi06.JPG","TNtebingtinggi08.JPG","TNtebingtinggi07.JPG","TNtebingtinggi09.JPG","TNTebing_Tinggi-7099a.jpg","TNDSC_2398.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNtebingtinggi09.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNTebing_Tinggi-7099a.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/47tebingtinggi/tn/TNDSC_2398.JPG"],"imgDesc":["From the road you can see the waterfall.","Originally we had decided to name this fall Ijok, but the sign tells us it is the Sg Tebing Tinggi","From the bridge looking down on the (shallow) pool in front of the fall.","From the road a cemented path leads down to the river.","High up the bridge crosses the stream","An attractive mixture of cascades and falls","We could not find a trail to reach this upper part of the falls","Broad cascades in the middle part","The lower fall.
