{"name":"Perdik Fall","description":"The Ulu Langat region can be called the \"backyard\" of Kuala Lumpur. Within easy reach of this bustling metroplis, there are several recreational forests (Hutan Lipur) and some attractive waterfalls. One of these Recreational Forests is Hutan Lipur Perdik.From Kg Ulu Langat you follow the road north to Pangsun. Don't follow the signs to the Gabai fall, but keep straight, until a junction with a signboard for Kg Hulu Perdik. Follow this small road until the end, where you can park your car. During our last visit we noticed a few new, but uninhabited O.A houses, built in the traditional way, without nails. A clear trail follows the small stream, which you have to cross three times. The trail is quite level. You will pass nice bamboo forests on your way.A clear trailAfter the third river crossing the trail starts to climb rather steeply. It will lead to the main fall, but there is a lower fall, which you can reach by following the river after the crossing. There are vague traces of a trail, partly you will just follow the stream. It will lead you in a short time to the lower Perdik fall. We did not try to scramble up from this lower fall, but backtracked to the river crossing and followed the path uphill, to the upper fall. The rock face is imposing, but the flow of water is not very big, except after heavy rain. There is a small pool, more for wading than for swimming. The surroundings are unspoiltWith a small poolCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
