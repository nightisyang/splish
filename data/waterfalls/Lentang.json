{"name":"Lentang","description":"The Lentang Recreational Forest is within easy reach of Kuala Lumpur. Although there are no real waterfalls, the park is a pleasant spot for an outing. To reach the place, just take the highway to Kuantan and take the exit to Lentang.It is possible to continue by car along the road, leading into the Forest Reserve. Depending on your car and your experience, you will park somewhere and then you can go on trekking.The trail along the river becomes smaller and smaller. At then end it became too overgrown to proceed without a parang. Not much further there should be a water catchment area.And this can really be called a waterfall.Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
