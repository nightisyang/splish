{"name":"Santubong Falls","description":"Gunung Santubong is located on the Damai Peninsula, 35km north of Kuching. This 810m high limestone hill is a popular destination for climbers and trekkers. Small streams feed two attractive waterfalls, which can be reached easily by well-maintained trails. To reach this trail you take the road from Kuching to Santubong. A few km before reaching the Damai resort, there is a small cafe where the trail starts. In about half an hour you will reach the main waterfall.In front of the waterfall a suspension bridge has been built, using a few dipterocarp giants for support. From the bridge you have a clear view of the attractive fall, which has two tiers. There is a nice pool, where you can take a relaxing bath.The second waterfall can be reached by following the trail back to the main road. This waterfall is smaller, but also has a pool for swimming.","state":"Sarawak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N01 44.65' E110 19.19'","verbatimLatitude":"N01 44.65'","verbatimLongitude":"E110 19.19'","decimalLatitude":1.74417,"decimalLongitude":110.31983,"decimalCoordinates":"1.74417,110.31983"},"coordinates":"N01 44.65'  E110 19.19'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical Falls","accessibility":"Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNsantubong01.JPG","TNsantubong02.JPG","TNsantubong03.JPG","TNsantubong04.JPG","TNsantubong05.JPG","TNsantubong06.JPG","TNsantubong07.JPG","TNsantubong08.JPG","TNsantubong09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/107santubong/tn/TNsantubong09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Gunung Santubong can be seen from far away.","The trail to the waterfall starts here","At strategic places usefuls signboards show you how to continue.","A suspension bridge has been constructed near the waterfall","The main Santubong fall","Popular with locals","A good place to take a bath","The second waterfall is smaller","The upper part of the second fall"],"imgFullResFilename":["santubong00.gif","santubong07.JPG","santubong08.JPG","santubong09.JPG","santubong02.JPG","santubong05.JPG","santubong01.JPG","santubong04.JPG","santubong03.JPG","santubong06.JPG"]},"url":"107santubong.php"}
