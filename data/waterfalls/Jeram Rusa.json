{"name":"Jeram Rusa","description":"This is a small fall in quiet estate surroundings. Shady surroundings with a sandy riverbed. It features a short curtain drop and a shallow sandy pool.Head to Ulu Beranang Town as the landmark. Before you arrive at the town there will be a left junction to Kg. Jeram Kedah. About 2.5kms in you will arrive at a forked junction. The left goes to Jeram Kedah, take the right. Not far off you will arrive at the end of the village. On the left there will be an abandoned home with a single parking spot within the fencing. Park here without obstructing the path. There is lack of parking space here, so large groups are advised to park further back and be considerate to the local community.Proceed by foot following the trail till you arrive at a rubber estate. Keep your ears peeled for the sound of the fall on your left. The fall is also visible if you observe carefully. Scramble down the slope to reach the fall.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~","state":"Negeri Sembilan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"2.89730, 101.95736","verbatimLatitude":"2.89730","verbatimLongitude":"101.95736","decimalLatitude":2.8973,"decimalLongitude":101.95736,"decimalCoordinates":"2.8973,101.95736"},"coordinates":"2.89730, 101.95736","waterSource":"Sg.
