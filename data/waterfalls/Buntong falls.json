{"name":"Buntong falls","description":"The Kledang mountain range separates the Perak river from the Kinta Valley. The highest point is Gunung Kledang at 808 m. On its slopes a waterfall can be found, the Buntong fall, very close to Ipoh and relatively unknown, except to locals. No signage at all. Directions: Coming from the Jelapang toll, take the expressway to Lumut. After about 8 km you will pass a petrol station. Now drive slowly. There are several dirt roads to the right. Take the THIRD one, counting from the petrol station. Park your car. After about 100 meter, the road splits, keep left. Soon you will reach the lower Buntong fall. A small fall, but with a nice pool. The trail continues at the left side of the fall, you will pass two more tiers, the last one with a dam.After a few hundred meters you will arrive at the foot of the main fall. A bare rock face, not a big flow of water during our visit, but interesting, so close to the city. It is possible to scramble up at the left side of this fall to the top, from where you have a nice view of Ipoh and surroundings.Google Earth has quite accurate maps for this region. The rock face of the main waterfall is clearly visible!Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
