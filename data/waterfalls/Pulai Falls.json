  "description": "Neglected jewel of JohorFrom the derelict carpark it is only a short walk to the first of the cascades. Another cascade follows and from the top of this one, you can seen the quite dramatic main fall.The main fall is a tall one and quite spectacular, because it comes down a narrow gorge.To the left of the fall, a path goes up to the top. But you can also reach the top by continuing from the car park. A few neglected chalets still remind you of the past glory. The road goes on to the top, where there is a military station (restricted area)The top tier of the Pulai waterfalls can be reached by river trekking. The coordinates are N1.59366 E103.53417. Pictures were taken during the rainy season. Normally the water flow is rather pathetic.Another view of the top fallCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.

      " Although the Pulai Falls are even mentioned in Wikipedia, and officially it belongs to the Gunung Pulai Recreational Forest, the place looks very run-down. That is a pity, because it has good potential to be a major tourist attraction in Johor. To reach the park, you take the road from Johor Baharu to Pontian and turn right at Pekan Nenas, the Pineapple Town. This road leads back to Kulai and probably you can reach the park also from this N-S highway exit. About 15 km from Pekan Nenas, a signboard leads to Gunung Pulai.",
