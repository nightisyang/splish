{"name":"Masai Falls","description":"Masai falls is a series of 3 falls in pristine jungle setting. The highest level features a rocky curved fall. All 3 falls are not very tall but do feature many interesting soaking pools.Head to Semenyih then proceed to Universal Memorial Park as the landmark. There is an alternate northern approach as well coming from Semenyih Dam but both are using the same access road.(refer ) Sections of the access road are narrow but tarred and well maintained. Normal sedan cars can travel along it all the way till the Theravada Buddhist Temple junction. Park by the side of the road without obstructing passing vehicles. There is a trail on the right going uphill around the temple. The jungle trail inside is clear but is used as a scrambler track as well. Proceed till you see a rather large river side camp on the left. Look for the trail junction on the right that heads upriver. Along the way you will pass the 1st fall, a boulder cascade.() Visitors whom are not familiar with jungle trails are advised to engage a guide.

To reach the upper fall proceed another ~15mins upriver.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along.
