{"name":"Jeram Tebrau","description":"The hills north of the NS-highway, just before you arrive in Seremban, are called the Galla forest reserve. The highest point is only 613 m, but it is enough for a small waterfall. The easiest way to reach Jeram Tebrau, coming from KL, is to take the Seremban exit, turn left and left again on the N38. After about 6 km you will see a signboard to Kg Pelegong and Jeram Tebrau. Just follow the signs until the end of the road. Warning: coming from Nilai there is another access road, which uses a very low underpass to cross the KTM line, no problem for a sedan car, but a Kembara can just make it.Jeram Tebrau is a typical example of a failed project. Money has been spent to built shelters, camp sites and toilets, and channel the water in two pools. But the pools are silted, everything is abandoned and broken. From the parking, a trail follows the stream. Not much water during our visit, some small cascades and after a few minutes you reach the small, but attractive waterfall. Not really a place to spend a day, but when you are around, why not have a look....Small but attractiveCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
