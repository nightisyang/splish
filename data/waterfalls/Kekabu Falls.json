{"name":"Kekabu Falls","description":"Hutan Lipur Lata Kekabu is a Recreational park in the vicinity of Chenderoh Lake. The road to the Park is less than a kilometer off the trunk road from Kuala Kangsar to Lenggong, Perak. Following a paved road, you will reach a large car park. From there, a short trail will lead you to the entrance.The river can be seen soon, there are picnic areas, sheds for resting and wooden chalets. Concrete walking paths are constructed for easy walking between the tall trees found in this area.At the edge of this picnic area a 4 meters tall waterfall discharges water into a pool. Follow a walking trail on the left leads visitors upstream. You will cross over the river on a suspension bridge.After going round a small hill, roughly a 300 meters walk, the main waterfall comes into view. Fairly dramatic though only 18 meters in height but about 40 meters wide. Plenty of cool, crystal clear water to fill a large pool of water. This is the focal point of the more adventurous picnickers.Officially the upper fall is out of bounds, as it is in a water catchment area. So you have to decide for yourself... It is possible to reach this fall, although care must be taken, the slopes can be slippery.Archived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
