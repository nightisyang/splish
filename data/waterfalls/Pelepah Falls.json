{"name":"Pelepah Falls","description":"The Pelepah waterfalls are located not far from Kota Tinggi and quite popular with Singaporeans. The trail head is located just before the entrance to the well-known Kota Tinggi falls. The easiest way in would be through a palm-oil plantation, but it is not clear if the guards will let you pass. A better way is to cross the bridge over the Kiri Pelepah river and then pass an opening in the fence. Basically you should follow more or less the river until you have passed the plantation.After you have left the plantation and entered the jungle, the trail is easy to follow. Soon you will reach the first small waterfall. The Pelapah falls are a series of falls and cascades, depending on how you count, there are about twelve tiers. Several times you have to scramble up a steep slope, where fixed ropes are very helpful.The hike is very pleasant, some of the tiers have a nice pool, some or more cascades. Lots of fish in the lower pools. During rain the rocks will be slippery, take care. The many tree trunks show that after heavy rain these falls will be powerful, and as you basically trekking in a ravine, you should be careful about flash-flooding.Level 11 is the main Pelepah fall, a long cascade. There is another small fall at the top of this cascade, after that you can keep following the river, a pleasant walk, but no more waterfallsLevel 12Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
