Locals frequent this spot as a hangout area.Jeram LambarThere are 2 possible ways to access this fall. By foot, visitors can either park at the Seremban RNR (South Bound) or enter the oil palm estate via Labu town. As the trail passes thru bumpy oil palm estate roads, only 4WD vehicles should attempt to drive to the fall. Locals also use motorcycles to access the fall quite easily.By foot, head to the Seremban RnR (south bound). There is a gated access path by the side of the compound.(ref ) Visitors can also drive to Labu KTM Station and use the access road to Kg Tekir.(ref )The estate trail is a clear path but has many junctions which can be confusing. Cross the bridge path and keep going straight till you reach the fall. It should take an estimated of ~30mins.By 4WD vehicle, head to Labu town and access from Kg Tekir junction.(ref Image 2) Visitors will pass the tunnel under the highway. Take the second junction on the left to proceed into the oil palm estate.The estate trail is a clear path and wide enough for single vehicle to cross the river bridge.
