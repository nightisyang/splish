{"name":"Jeram Kedah","description":"The Jeram Kedah falls are located in the Lenggeng Forest Reserve. Follow the trunk route nr 1 from Kajang southward, pass Sememyih and turn left on the N34 to Lenggeng. Just before you reach Ulu Berenang, you will find a road to Kg Jeram Kedah. Follow this road through nice countryside until the end.The first impression of the place is rather unfavorable. Remains of an old water pipeline and a ruined reservoir show that in the past there must have been a water catchment here. There are no facilities, you must scramble down to the river bed to reach the fall. Locals use the waterfall to take a bath and relax. Cross the stream and follow a trail to the left to reach the top of the fallThe upper part of Jeram Kedah comes as an unexpected surprise. The river flows through a ravine, it is a quiet, unspoilt place, with a nice second fall. A perfect place to spend a few hours. A quiet spectator.Archived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
