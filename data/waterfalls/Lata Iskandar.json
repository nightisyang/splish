Far before the fall is reached, the first parked cars and stalls appear. The falls are visible from the road, and there is a big sign, welcoming the visitor to the Hutan Lipur Lata Iskandar. Souvenir shops, food stalls, don't expect solitude here.","See pic below for present situation","                                                    ","                                                            ","At the bottom of the cascades a small bridge permits to cross the stream. ","Wading pools are a good place for families to bath their children, organise picknicks and enjoy their holiday trip in all possible ways"," Cemented steps to the right side of the fall lead to the top of the cascade","From the bridge one has a good view of the main cascade","This young spectator seems to hesitate if he will take the plunge","The main cascade as seen from the steps leading to the top of the fall","At the top of the main cascade the cemented steps end. There is a second cascade here, which (of course) is more quiet than the lower one. It is possible to scramble up a vague trail to the right of this cascade."," Be careful, the rocks can be slippery","                                                        ","From the top of the second cascade, one can look down and see the swirling water cascading down. Deep below bathers are enjoying the cool water."," Then, the final suprise, a small real waterfall with an almost private swimming pool. "," A nice reward for the scrambling!
