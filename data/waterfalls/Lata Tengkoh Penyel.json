{"name":"Lata Tengkoh Penyel","description":"Access to this remote waterfall is easy, but it will take time. From Ipoh it is a 2-3 hour drive! But the road is good. Until a couple of years ago you needed a 4WD after Bawong, but the road has been tarred now until Kuala Mu.After Bawong you follow the road to Kuala Mu for about 30 km. Turn left to Pos Yum. After a few km you reach Kampong Pendeq where you can park your car. The Orang Asli in this village have done a wonderful job, taking care about the Penyel waterfall, which is a 10 minutes walk from the village. It is about 500 meters to the fall.Near the fall the Orang Asli have constructed a few chalets and pondoks. Very friendly atmosphere. is a tall fall with a nice shallow pool, safe to take a refreshing bathLata PenyelHere is a video of the waterfall","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N4 55.95 E101 19.69","verbatimLatitude":"N4 55.95","verbatimLongitude":"E101 19.69","decimalLatitude":4.9325,"decimalLongitude":101.32817,"decimalCoordinates":"4.9325,101.32817"},"coordinates":"N4 55.95 E101 19.69","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical","accessibility":"Short walk from carpark","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNimg_9542.jpg","TNimg_9572.jpg","TNimg_9541.jpg","TNimg_9567.jpg","TNimg_9550.jpg","TNimg_9566.jpg","TNimg_9543.jpg","TNimg_9551.jpg","TNimg_9555.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9542.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9572.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9541.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9567.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9550.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9566.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9543.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9551.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/171penyel/tn/TNimg_9555.jpg"],"imgDesc":["Sign at the entrance of the village","The villagers have built a nice path to the waterfall.
