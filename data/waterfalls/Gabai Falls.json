Next you follow the road to Kg Pangsun for about 7 km until Batu 18 where you turn right. After 6 km you will see the signboard for the Falls. Turn left and follow the road until the carpark.","From the carpark it is not far to the first cascade. This cascade is tall but not very steeply inclined."," Visitors can find a nice place on the rocks and enjoy their bath with jacuzzi.","At several places shelters have been erected.","Cemented steps lead to the upper regions of the falls","Bridges make the crossing of the stream an easy job. In the background the second cascade is visible","The upper cascades have nice pools, inviting for a bath","As is mostly the case, the upper falls are less crowded","Some daredevils using the cascade as a slide.","It is possible to continue after the cascades, just following the stream.As a reward you will find another attractive waterfall!"],"imgFullResFilename":["gabai00.gif","gabai11.JPG","gabai12.JPG","gabai03.JPG","gabai08.JPG","gabai05.JPG","gabai02.JPG","gabai09.JPG","gabai01.JPG","gabai07.JPG","gabai06.JPG","gabai10.JPG","gabai04.JPG"]},"url":"06gabai.php"}
