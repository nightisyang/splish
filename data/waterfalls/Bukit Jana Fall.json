{"name":"Bukit Jana Fall","description":"The Bukit Jana fall is really a baby one, with easy access. From Kuala Lumpur take the North South Expressway, then Exit 148 Taiping Utara. Follow the road for 9km and turn left to A4. After 1km, turn right on Jalan Bukit Jana, and follow this road until the end. The golf course is at your left. After passing the barrier, you walk aling the stream and you will reach the waterfall after about 100 meter. The water is very clear. The trail continues until the remains of a water catchment.","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N 4 53.80 E 100 45.14","verbatimLatitude":"N 4 53.80","verbatimLongitude":"E 100 45.14","decimalLatitude":4.89667,"decimalLongitude":100.75233,"decimalCoordinates":"4.89667,100.75233"},"coordinates":"N 4 53.80  E 100 45.14","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Cascade","accessibility":"From carpark","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNP9030092copy.jpg","TNDSC_0014.JPG","TNDSC_0004.JPG","TNP9030079copy.jpg","TNDSC_0008.JPG","TNDSC_0010.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNP9030092copy.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNDSC_0014.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNDSC_0004.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNP9030079copy.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNDSC_0008.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/132bukitjana/tn/TNDSC_0010.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Follow this road","Park your car and walk from here","The baby waterfall","A nice pool with clear water","The trail continues.
