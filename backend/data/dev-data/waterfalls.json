    "description": "From Kuala Lumpur take the North South Expressway. Exit 148 Taiping Utara. Follow the road for 9km to Kamunting and turn left to the A4 and after that the A5. Follow this road for another 22km to Kg Jelai and turn right on the A206. Follow this road until the end. You will pass a gate which is normally open. Park your car at the water catchment area. From here the clear trail starts. It follows the river, which you can hear all the time, down in the ravine. The river has lots of cascades and small waterfalls, but access from the trail is difficult because of the steep slopes. It is possible to river trek, when the water level is not too high, but this will be slow going.The trail passes several durian plantations and fruit orchards. Here and there you will see temporary shelters. Occasionally a vague trail leads down to the river, to a cascade or waterfall. After about 1 km you will see the main fall through the trees. You will have to scramble down the ravine here, the easiest way is to follow a small stream which crosses the trail, when you are near the fall. Be prepared for leeches.The main fall is impressive, especially after rain. Be careful, however, the rocks are slippery and the current is strong. The trail continues after the main fall, after a while you will reach a confluence of two rivers, with nice cascades.THere may be more waterfalls and cascades upstream, there is a lot to explore here. The whole river is pristine and unspoilt. Keep it that way!!More cascades upstream ",

    "description": "Harimau Berjemur in Malay Language means tiger basking in the sunshine. Somebody said that tigers love to hang around at this waterfall on a hot day. Can we really meet wild tigers here? It really depends on your luck.The Harimau Berjemur Waterfall is located in the north area of Lesong Forest Reserve at Rompin and it is a famous camping destination for local 4WD groups. The easiest & fastest way is from Segamat by using road no.12 to Bandar Muadzam Sha. Turn right into an oil palm plantation after Ulu Keratong.FInally you enter the Lesong Forest Reserve using a logging roadThe logging road can be muddy and slippery, especially after rainAt some places guidance is needed to avoid hazards. After ~ 50 km you reach the campsite which can easily take about 30 people. There is a small cascade near the campsite, just nice for those who don’t like to walk too far away from the campsite.The trail to the main fall starts at the opposite side of the river. The jungle trail goes through bushes and then follows the riverbank again, forcing everybody to trek carefully on the wet slippery rock surface. After about 15 minutes you will reach already the Harimau Berjemur main tier.The adventurous can scramble up the trail at the left of the waterfall to the upper tier. ",

Access is easy, because a (winding!) road is leading from Gurun to the Gunung Jerai Regency resort.Just before you reach the resort, the trail starts to the right. Concrete steps bring you in about half an hour to the fall. Quite a steep descent. You approach the waterfall in an interesting, rather unusual way: from above! Take care when you go down to the bottom, the rocks can be slippery. Not a big water flow, probably seasonal, but the setting of the fall is romantic, with a nice (shallow) pool.The Alur Naga fallThere should be a trail between this fall and the Puteri Mandi fall, hundreds of meters lower, but we did not try to find it.Here is a video of the fall",

J123 to Simpang Bekoh. Turn right at the second junction by following the road signboard to Asahan. When you reach Asahan, look for Laman Tiga Budaya Asahan. . Soon you will reach a big car park.Turn right into the dirt road when you see the Gunung Ledang (Asahan) Registration PostThe trail continues to the right of the registration post and follows a drain which delivesr the stream water to the nearby waterwork station. Most of the terrain is quite gentle, except for some detours where tree have been fallen.After 1 hour trekking, you reach the Asahan Fall. The volume of water is a bit low, and the water flowing down always remains in contact with the bedrock. The water pool here is small but deep. Water has a brownish colour, just like dipping in a bowl of tea.The Asahan Fall",

This is the region where the Bidayuh live, no longer in longhouses, but in attractive kampungs. One of these is Kg Sadir, on the slopes of the Penrissen range. There are several waterfalls near this kampung.The easiest way to reach Kg Sadir from Kuching, is to follow first the signage to the Semenggoh Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre and then to the Borneo Highlands Resort. Finally to Kg Sadir, where the road ends and you can park your car. The road quality is ok, except for some potholes.Two waterfalls, Skedu and Ban Buan Sadir are quite close to the kampung. For the other two, Ban Buan Kukuot and Mabi, some trekking is needed. As there are many trails used by the farmers to reach their padi fields, it is a good idea to arrange for a guide in the kampung.  is located very near to the village. It can not be missed because the villagers have constructed a cemented path to this fall.

On your way to Ban Buan Kukoat and Mabi , you’ll see several houses at the foothill.

Coordinates: N01º 06.43' E110º 16.47'Well-kept trails lead to the other two falls. Streams are crossed on bamboo bridges. On the way to the Ban Buan Kukuot Fall, near a bridge, a small detour leads to the Mabi Fall.

At the Batu 18 junction of the road from Ulu Langat to Kg Pangsun there is a signboard indictating three waterfalls in Ulu Langat: Gabai, Tekala and BatangsiThe Gabai and Tekala falls are signposted and easy to find.But for Batangsi there is no further clue.On the map there is a Sungei Batangsi and asking around for directions at that location, there was no mistake, yes there was a Lata Batangsi and a small road was pointed at.So we tried our luck",

        "During a next trip to Batangsi the mystery was finally solved. Our plan was to see if there was a waterfall further upstream. But the guards at the fish farm said that there was nothing. However, on our way back to the mainroad, we saw a small road leading to the river with remains of some shelters. And the river had some nice cascades there. So it is clear now that this is the location of the Batangsi \"falls\"",

    "description": " Falls is a series of 4 waterfalls with the pre-independence water catchment dam being the main featured fall. It is quite a tall structure with 9-steps stairs drop that results in a picturesque scene. There is a small pool at the base of the dam with a number of piping support pillars. There are 2 more falls situated downriver while the last fall (Lata Kancil) is situated another 300m upriver. Forestry permit is required to visit Lata Kancil.Batu Cherandong DamHead to Kuala Kubu Baru as the landmark. From the north, visitors will pass the KKB town and the Fire & Rescue Station on the left. From the south, there is a junction on the right near Rasa town that will take you directly to the Sg. Selangor bridge.(ref Image 1) There is a blue hanging bridge at the road junction to the trail.Proceed straight on the tarred road all the way till you reach a forked Y-junction. There is 2 paths on the left going into the palm oil estate.(ref Image 2) Take the left path. The road condition inside is narrow & not tarred thou quite flat and possible to pass by normal sedan cars. At the end of the path there is a junction down to the left that will take you to Buluh Telor campsite.(ref )Image 3Parking space can be limited if there is a large crowd. There are more parking spaces inside following the dirt trail. Ensure to park without obstructing the road! The trail to the waterfall is a short and easy one starting from Faruq campsite(signposted!) under local orang asli care. There will be an entry fee of RM2 to visit the Batu Cherandong Dam. An additional forestry permit is required to visit the upper Lata Kancil falls. From here on visitors may take either the river side trail or the high pass jungle trail. There is a clearly signposted junction to indicate Batu Cherandong Dam junction if you take the high pass.(ref Image 4)Visitors who wish to visit the lower falls can scramble down the trail after passing the river crossing. Lata Four is the 1st waterfall that flows directly into Sg. Selangor.Above the dam area is a shallow sandy riverbed. There is a messy looking cascade close by. Lata Kancil is another ~25min upriver. There is only a shallow pool here. Quite a tall fall with 3 tier drop.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ",

One of these tributaries has a well-known waterfall, Tembakah, but there are more, only known to the locals, as this area is very remote.No signage, you need a guide, must ask around to find one. A good starting point for exploration is the La Hot Spring resort.We found a guide in a coffee shop. He knew the way to a powerful fall, had been there decades(!) ago when they were logging the region. We decided to give it a try.Where the Ulu Besut tar road comes to an end, you must first follow oil plantation roads, a 4WD would be handy. Next you follow clear jungle trails beside the river, until you can hear the waterfall. Scramble down and a beautiful waterfall is your reward.Our guide tried in vain to find the upper fall, supposedly even taller. After giving up our search, we relaxed at the middle falls, more like cascades, just above the lower fall. You will notice that our guide was carrying a gun. We saw footprints that belonged to a \"badak\" according to him. A rhinoceros??Here is a video of the Belawan waterfall:",

A short distance in there will be clearing, visitors can park here without obstruction passing traffic.There is a clear trail going down to the fall from the top. Unfortunately at the time of visit the area is littered with rubbish. It seems irresponsible individuals have been dumping their domestic waste here. You will reach the fall in less than 5 mins.There are significant amounts of domestic waste being disposed off by the side of the cliff on the left of the fall.(refer Image 2) Jan remarked that this location was pristine went he last visited.

    "description": "This must be the nearest waterfall to Kuala Lumpur. Here, in the outskirts of town, a local group of enthusiasts have created a maze of trails in the hilly region of Bukit Apeh. A popular destination for jogging, it can be crowded here, especially during weekends. The trails are maintained very well. Because some visitors misbehaved, the original access from Taman Wangsa has been closed. A new trail has been opened from Taman Saga in Ampang. The first part of the trail is quite steep, until Bukit Saga. From there it is more level, you pass the top of the hill, where a sign guides you to the waterfalls.When you continue after reaching the top of the hill, the trail stays level for a while and finaly slopes down steeply to a nice small waterfall.This waterfall is a nice reward after a quite strenuous walk. It will be interesting to see if it is possible to follow the stream down into the Ulu Langat Valley. The distance to the nearest road is about 1 km, as the crow flies. Altitude difference about 200 mOr in the waterThe old version of this page ",

At the end of Jalan Ametis Utama there is a right junction going uphill to Gunung Tampin.() There is an open space clearing on the right for visitors to park.Follow the tar road trail for about 600meters and near the rest hut on the left there is a hill trail used in the past for construction of transmission towers. A few hundred meters in and the trail will reach a river crossing. Scramble upriver and the fall will be in sight.Image 1There are some smaller cascades upriver but no trail. It is mostly river trekking and the forest vegetation can be quite wild. Close to the end near the old water catchment dam there is a section of steep soil erosion as well. Photos below.Exploration Notes : Nothing interesting found upriver. Rocky boulders & underground river beyond old catchment dam. \"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ",

On its slopes a waterfall can be found, the Buntong fall, very close to Ipoh and relatively unknown, except to locals. No signage at all. Directions: Coming from the Jelapang toll, take the expressway to Lumut. After about 8 km you will pass a petrol station. Now drive slowly. There are several dirt roads to the right. Take the THIRD one, counting from the petrol station. Park your car. After about 100 meter, the road splits, keep left. Soon you will reach the lower Buntong fall. A small fall, but with a nice pool. The trail continues at the left side of the fall, you will pass two more tiers, the last one with a dam.After a few hundred meters you will arrive at the foot of the main fall. A bare rock face, not a big flow of water during our visit, but interesting, so close to the city. It is possible to scramble up at the left side of this fall to the top, from where you have a nice view of Ipoh and surroundings.Google Earth has quite accurate maps for this region.

    "description": "The picturesque kampung Janda Baik is located less than one hour away from metropolis KL. It is a popular destination for the townsfolk during weekends. Not many of them know that an attractive waterfall can be found in this region, up the slopes of Gunung Nuang. To go there, you take the highway exit to Janda Baik and drive all the way up the valley.To find the correct route, please study the GPS-map carefully. Where the farmroad ends and the jungle starts, look for a small trail to your left through the grass. The trail, although quite overgrown, is remarkably clear.The jungle trail continues for another 1.5 km, gradually going uphill. We needed a parang, so progress was slow. Only at the end, we could hear the sound of rushing water.The reward for all the hard work is a very nice powerful waterfall, in the middle of a pristine jungle.Lunchtime before going backThe trail seemed to end here, and it is still far to the top of G. Nuang. We have given the fall the name Cemperoh Fall, there might be a local name for the fall. There might be even more falls in the region, still waiting to be discovered. ",

    "description": "A few years ago a new road has been opened to the Cameron Highlands. It starts at Simpang Pulai, south of Ipoh and enters the Cameron Highlands at Kg Raja. From this road one of the tallest falls of Peninsular Malaysia can be easily reached. This fall, Chelik, is still almost completely unknown.About 17 km after passing the N-S highway, there is a very sharp bend in the road. In this bend a small road goes down into the valley to a few Orang Asli houses. Take this exit (be careful!) and park your car near the houses.The trail is slightly overgrown, a parang might come in handy. But the trail is clear and not steep. Just when you wonder where the waterfall could be, after a bend in the trail, you can spot it through the trees to your left. It becomes only visible at the last moment, so it is not easy to estimate how tall it is. But that it is tall, is very clear, it is not easy to take a picture of the complete fall.The lower partThere is no place to camp near the fall, and also there is not really a pool for swimming. We had no time to check if it was possible to climb up to the top of the fall. If possible at all, it will not be easy.Archived page avalaible ",

    "description": "The Chiling Falls are probably the most beautiful waterfalls of Selangor. They can be reached after an adventurous trek along the river, which has to be crossed many times. To reach the trail head, you take the road from Kuala Kubu Baru to the Gap. After passing the Selangor Dam, you cross the bridge on the Chiling river. Just after this bridge you can park you car. Follow the road for about 100 meter, the trail head is clearly indicated. Soon you will arrive an open field beside the river, with some buildings and a campsite, maintained by the Fisheries department. At the moment, and temporarily, the Chiling falls are open to the public only from Friday until Sunday! The first river crossing is by means of a recently constructed suspension bridge. Strict rules have been introduced: after the bridge camping, fishing, making fires, etc is no more allowed. A good idea, in the past several fatal accidents have occured with flash-flooding. Hopefully the rangers will be able to maintain the place. The trail is clear and follows the river, but you have to cross the river five more times. So you must be prepared to get wet feet and probably more... Kampung Adidas are very useful here. After rainfall the water level can reach until your waist and the current can be strong. Take care, especially with children. After trekking for about one and a half hour, the river makes a right-turn and suddenly you will see the lower waterfall. A quite spectacular reward. It is a powerful fall with a large pool. Lots of fish, which like to nibble your feet..:-)There are two more falls. You reach them, by scrambling up the steep slope, just before the last river crossing. You will pass another waterfall (not accessible) before you reach the third waterfall. This place is much quieter than the lower fall and very well suited for a relaxed picnic.This is an interesting trek and a beautiful fall. But accidents have happened here, due to flash-flooding. Don't make this trip in adverse weather conditions! The river will become impassable when the water level is too high.Access to the Chiling falls is limited to weekends only (Fri, Sat, Sun), because of ongoing research by the Selangor fisheries department. If public holidays fall outside the weekend, access will in general not be possibleAfter some accidents have happened, the Fisheries Department has placed a signboard where the trail to the upper fall starts. So officially the upper falls are out of bounds nowTo visit Chiling you have to register at the counter (RM 1). Camp fee is RM 4 per tent. You have to pay a deposit of RM 50/150, depending on the group size. Refundable if you leave the campsite clean. Contactinformation.

From here a small road passes under the Highway and follows the river for about 10 km to the Orang Asli Kampung of Ulu Geroh.In cooperation with the Malaysian Nature, Society Orang Asli have received a training to guide visitors to the various places of interests. The waterfall can be found easily without a guide, but it might be a good idea to support the local population. Rates however are very steep. Follow the road until the end, from where a clear trail brings you in about half a km to the fall.The trail ends at a nice, attractive waterfall with a shallow pool. Unspoilt environment, no rubbish at all. Keep it that way!",

But not many people (not even the Niah NP staff) would expect that waterfalls can be found here.Somewhere in the remote area of oil palm plantations, there are a lot of waterfalls waiting to be discovered. Giam Klimau is one of them. In Bidayuh language ‘giam’ means waterfall or rapid. Access to the fall is through an oil palm plantation. The bumpy terrain is not that easy for a sedan car,a 4WD and a guide are advisable. The oil palm plantation is under private company, you will have to report at several security check points. It will take about 30mins driving (15km) to reach the trail head. There is a visible trail leading to waterfall, it is just a short walk through the bushes.Giam Klimau has an amazing geographical feature. It is a curtain fall! The water just drops on the hard rock surface instead of a pool. The pool is several meters away. The most amazing thing is the upper hard rock layer, protruding and forming a sheltered place underneath. When you stand inside, you can hear the water flowing above the rock layer. You wonder how this landscape can be formed, by corrosion? Nature is awesome.",

Try to find a guide here.An easy trail leads first trough plantations until you reach the Jangkar river after about 45 minutes. Here the trail ends and you start trekking the river. Huge boulders make this a tough trek, only possible under good weather conditions. Don't try this trek when it has rained or might rain! Even with good weather, you must be careful. But it is also big fun. After another hour you reach the spectacular waterfall, with a huge deep pool. A nice place to relax, enjoy your lunch and take a bath. The slopes are steep, no trail, so we did not even try to climb to the top. It seems that there are more falls upstream!The upper part of Jangkar fall ",

    "description": "Jeram Glami is a short & wide 2-tier cascade fall. The top section features gentle cascades with small soaking pools that flows down to a larger pool. This river is still recovering from the devastating floods back in Dec 2021. Many sections of the river are piled up with log debris and there are landslides at sections of the riverbank causing water quality to be murky as well.Head to Titi town as the landmark and proceed to Pusat Penyelidikan Perikanan Air Tawar FRI. Heading from Kuala Klawang town the access junction is on the left before Titi(refer image 1). There is a bridge before the research institute. The trail is on the right before the bridge(refer image 2). Plenty of parking spots here as there is a wide road reserve.The clear jungle trail is about 1.6km and leads to the river. The rest of the way is river trekking on the shallow riverbed.Detailed photos of the falls. Nothing found upriver despite river trekking another 1.2km.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along.

Just before you reach Ulu Berenang, you will find a road to Kg Jeram Kedah. Follow this road through nice countryside until the end.The first impression of the place is rather unfavorable. Remains of an old water pipeline and a ruined reservoir show that in the past there must have been a water catchment here. There are no facilities, you must scramble down to the river bed to reach the fall. Locals use the waterfall to take a bath and relax. Cross the stream and follow a trail to the left to reach the top of the fallThe upper part of Jeram Kedah comes as an unexpected surprise. The river flows through a ravine, it is a quiet, unspoilt place, with a nice second fall. A perfect place to spend a few hours. A quiet spectator.Archived page available ",

At the traffic light junction of Masjid Kariah Kg. Repah, take the left junction heading to Kuala Pilah Route 9 (). Visitors coming from the north (Johol) will have to take a detour as there is a fully collapsed bridge (2.514384, 102.241474 - July 2022) that is not passable.

Bachang, there is a left junction going into the village.() Proceed along the tarred road to reach the recreational resort.()The recreational resort has seen better days. Buildings are empty and in poor state. Park without obstructing any path or building access. Visitors can hike up the hill to use the water pipe trail or skip into the river down below to take the river trail. By river trail, it would take less than 15mins to reach the 1st fall.

Because it is not yet well known and takes a 2-3 hour hike to reach, you are likely to have this spot to yourself. The trail starts at a small Orang Asli village on a side road of the road to the Gabai falls.The hike is long but moderate, with almost no steep climbs. The first time you go, get an orang asli guide from the small village since there are side tracks which could take you the wrong way. The trail starts on a motorcycle path used by orang asli when they go hunting. In parts of the jungle, the path is quite overgrown but always passable.The falls itself is about 15-20 meters in height with a nice pool at the bottom. The guide dived into a small cave and came up with fish for dinner.Leeches? Moderate number to many when it's wet.Text and pictures courtesy of Rani and Dick Sandler ",

It features a short curtain drop and a shallow sandy pool.Head to Ulu Beranang Town as the landmark. Before you arrive at the town there will be a left junction to Kg. Jeram Kedah. About 2.5kms in you will arrive at a forked junction. The left goes to Jeram Kedah, take the right. Not far off you will arrive at the end of the village. On the left there will be an abandoned home with a single parking spot within the fencing. Park here without obstructing the path. There is lack of parking space here, so large groups are advised to park further back and be considerate to the local community.Proceed by foot following the trail till you arrive at a rubber estate. Keep your ears peeled for the sound of the fall on your left. The fall is also visible if you observe carefully. Scramble down the slope to reach the fall.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~",

    "description": "The hills north of the NS-highway, just before you arrive in Seremban, are called the Galla forest reserve. The highest point is only 613 m, but it is enough for a small waterfall. The easiest way to reach Jeram Tebrau, coming from KL, is to take the Seremban exit, turn left and left again on the N38. After about 6 km you will see a signboard to Kg Pelegong and Jeram Tebrau. Just follow the signs until the end of the road. Warning: coming from Nilai there is another access road, which uses a very low underpass to cross the KTM line, no problem for a sedan car, but a Kembara can just make it.Jeram Tebrau is a typical example of a failed project. Money has been spent to built shelters, camp sites and toilets, and channel the water in two pools. But the pools are silted, everything is abandoned and broken. From the parking, a trail follows the stream. Not much water during our visit, some small cascades and after a few minutes you reach the small, but attractive waterfall. Not really a place to spend a day, but when you are around, why not have a look....Small but attractive ",

It takes the longest time and is the toughest trail to the summit. Normally hikers take only 1 day up & down from the summit, but via Ulu Jementah yout need 2 days to reach the summit. Along the route there are 5 checkpoints and Jeram Tinggi Fall is the first checkpoint.Take road no.23 from Tangkak to Jementah. Then turn into Jalan Kolam Air near Kampung Paya Jakas, follow the country road and drive all the way to the jungle border. Generally, the terrain is quite flat. The only steep ascent is the slope after the first river crossing. Because of the fallen leaves it can be quite slippery.One hour trekking from the carpark, you should reach the Jeram Tinggi Fall. There is a small campsite near the waterfall. ",

They were discovered by the British in 1895 and became a popular place for a relaxing bath and a family picnic. Access is very easy from the Seremban-Kuala Kelawang road. In earlier days you just had to park beside the road, but at present this road is being upgraded to a four-lane highway. A special exit, clearly signposted, has been made to Jeram ToiThe park has shelters, toilets, barbeque pits, and a cemented walkway with steps leading up the gorge. The place might be crowded on weekends, but on a weekday it is quite desolate. That the entrance to the park is no longer off the main road, might explain the impression of deacy.The setting of the waterfalls is very romantic. The huge forest trees make this a cool place, even on a hot day. Altogether there are four major falls.After the last fall, you have reached the top of the gorge. If you like you can follow the trail further along the river.View of the valley deep downArchived page available ",

    "description": "Besides the Maxwell Hill fall, visible from the Lake Gardens in Taiping, there is another conspicuous waterfall, visible from nearby Kamunting. But how to reach this fall?With the help of local people we found the trail. It starts actually from the trail to the Maxwell Hill fall. So you start at the gate of the water treatment plant and follow the track just outside the fence. After a few hundred meters the fence turns sharply to the left. Here the trail splits. To the right, starting with some steps, it leads to the Maxwell fall. For the Kamunting fall you turn left and keep following the fence. Where the fence ends a nice trail continues following a water pipe.Follow this pipe for about 45 minutes. You will pass an attractive small waterfall. The pipe ends at a small reservoir. About one hundred meter before this reservoir, a vague trail, indicated by yellow markers, starts to the right. This is a steep climb up, scrambling required, but here and there ropes will help you. After the initial steep part, the trail levels a bit and you will start hearing the sound of falling water. Soon you will reach the fall.It is a tall rock face. Not a lot of water during our visit, but that will be different after heavy rain. No real pool, but there are places to take a bath. Maybe it is possible to climb to the top of the fall, keeping the right side, but it will not be easy, parang needed.The lower part. Not a real poolThe fall is in pristine condition, keep it that way! ",

Concrete walking paths are constructed for easy walking between the tall trees found in this area.At the edge of this picnic area a 4 meters tall waterfall discharges water into a pool. Follow a walking trail on the left leads visitors upstream. You will cross over the river on a suspension bridge.After going round a small hill, roughly a 300 meters walk, the main waterfall comes into view. Fairly dramatic though only 18 meters in height but about 40 meters wide. Plenty of cool, crystal clear water to fill a large pool of water. This is the focal point of the more adventurous picnickers.Officially the upper fall is out of bounds, as it is in a water catchment area. So you have to decide for yourself... It is possible to reach this fall, although care must be taken, the slopes can be slippery.Archived page available ",

    "description": "The Kinabalu National Park is of course famous for the Gunung Kinabalu, the pitcher plants and the bird life. But there are waterfalls too! Many of them will never have been visited, because there is no access. However, a few are accesible. When you start climbing to Gunung Kinabalu, after passing the Timpohon gate, you will pass the Carson Fall. The waterfall is not spectacular but the location is scenic and you can fill your water bottles here. After climbing the mountain, many people spend a night at the Poring Hot Springs Resort to relax. This is still part of the large Kinabalu National Park (754 square kilometers!)It is only a short walk from the hot springs to an attractive waterfall, the Kipungit Fall. You can take a refreshing bath here. When you continue the trail, you will reach the Langanan Fall, but we had no time to visit this fall.A contribution from Hamidi Mohd Noh. From the Kipungit fall a clear trail leads in about 1 hour and 45 minutes to the Langanan Fall. The clearly signposted trail is steep uphill and can be slippery after rain. Nice views. The Langanan waterfall is a tall and powerful fall.From the Timpohon Gate, another tall \"ribbon\" fall is visible, far away. Also visible from the Tamparuli - Ranau road. This is the Kadamaian Fall. Not yet visited by us, access will not be easy, the starting point is Kg Kiau, where you have to find a guide.",

The waterfall is famous among the locals and can be crowded especially during weekends & holidays. When you come from Kota Kinabalu city, just follow the directions to Inanam. In Inanam you take right at the roundabout to Jalan Kionsom. At the end of this road, just after the Mari Mari cultural village, you will find the waterfall park.The waterfall has four main tiers of different types. The first and second tier are easyly accessible by using a cemented path. The third fall is inaccessible. To go to the last tier, you have to scramble up the slope. Be careful of every step, the rocks and roots can be very slippery.The narrow path is clear unless some part is blocked by the fallen trunk. Other than that, it's easy to follow. When you see the fall from the slope, try to find a route to go down to the stream, there is an obvious route. Hold tight at the tree roots and scramble down the steep slope slowly. Following the narrow jungle trail further upstream, you will find some mini cascades and an abandoned hanging bridge.",

At an altitude of between 150-450 metres, this plateau is punctuated with bands of hardened limestone which have formed several beautiful waterfalls. There are four trails offered in the park and one of them leads to the waterfall. The  can be reached in approximate 1.5 hours by using the Waterfall Trail.First park your car near the entrance of the national park. After registration at the park office, follow the sealed road that starts from the park office and turn into the Waterfall Trail when you see the Waterfall Trail signboard.The last stretch to the waterfall is on a wet slippery rock surface. Take care. Visitors are advised to walk on the cemented dots.Kubah WaterfallThe main waterfall consists of 2 sections, the main section drops from 10m height onto a wide rock platform. Below this platform is a small pool great for a dip. Part of the stream forms a separate waterfall to the rightNear the entrance of Kubah National Park there are a few smaller waterfalls.",

    "description": "Trekking to  is easy, but reaching the trail head may take some time. This waterfall is located in the Gunung Bubu range, about 25 km West of Ipoh. Quite close, but to reach it, you have to cross the mighty Perak river, either near Kuala Kangsar, or near Parit. Either way, you have to aim for the small village of Manong. About 3 km north of Manong at coordinates N4 37.18 E100 52.29, you take a minor road to the left. Follow this road until you reach an open field where you can park your car. It is a campsite with a stream nearby where you can take a bath.From here you follow a logging road which crosses the stream at a small waterfallAfter about 1.5 km a small trail leaves the logging road and forks right. From here it is not far to the Batu Pecah waterfall.Lata Batu PecahA few hundred meters upstream there is another waterfall, quite powerful, but difficult to reach as there is no trail. As we do not know the name, we have baptised it Lata Naga Air",

    "description": "Lata Beringin Falls is a series of 6 waterfalls within close distance of each other. The main and 1st fall is Lata Beringin while the 6th fall is Jeram Air Mata Gajah. The falls here are not very tall but do feature a number of nice pools.Head to Hulu Langat as the landmark. Pass the Masjid Pekan Bt. 14 and proceed to Kg Sungai Semungkis. There is many junctions in Hulu Langat, the village access junction is signposted.(ref .) Proceed to follow the main road all the way straight till the end. There is an abandoned guard house but it is no longer gated.(ref ) Proceed on the dirt path to Lata Beringin campsite. The dirt road is quite flat and passable to sedan cars. Visitors will pass many river camp spots managed by private operators. Keep an eye out for the signboard that is near the destination.(ref )Image 1Image 2Image 3The Lata Beringin Falls campsite has a bamboo fencing and is managed by private operators. There is a parking and entrance fee charged to visit the falls.(ref  & 5) The campsite is well managed and includes surau & toilet facilities. The 1st fall is located just beside the bamboo camping spots with a wide but not very deep pool.Image 4The clear jungle trail starts from the left of the river going uphill.(ref ) Sections of the trail are prepared with ropes for easy hiking during wet seasons. The trail does not directly pass all the waterfalls on the way in. Visitors who wish to visit the numerous falls in between will have to take the trail junction down the slope and scramble back to the same trail to continue upriver. The trail ends at Jeram Air Mata Gajah, a 2-step cascade waterfall with a rock closely resembling an elephant head. There is a nice pool at this level as well.

    "description": "Access to this beautiful, unknown, waterfall is from the old Gombak-Bentong road. Coming from KL by the Karak highway, you take the exit to the village of Bukit Tinggi, where you can have breakfast. Then you follow the old road to Bentong for about 16 km. On your way you pass a nice unnamed waterfall and a Hot Springs.From the junction a small road leads in about 3 km to the resort. The quality of this access road was reasonable during our visit. Should be possible with a normal car, although a 4WD might come in handy during the rainy season.The trail is well maintained, at some places a bit overgrown. Follow it for another 2 km (half an hour). The river is always audible down in the ravine to your right. During our visit the location where you start the descent to the river, was indicated by an arrow, made of tree braches and twigs. Take care, this descent is very steep!This waterfall is one of the most beautiful that can be found near KL. The water volume is high, even in the dry season and the pool is huge. There are several suitable campsites around. A vague trail to the right of the fall leads to the upper fall, which is more modest, but also has a nice pool. Upstream the river becomes quiet.This waterfall is a relatively unknown and therefore unspoilt gem, quite near KL. Keep it that way! Take only pictures, leave only footprints. ",

To visit them, you must start either from Baling or Sik. From Baling you follow the K10 and then the K157.From Sik the road (175) crosses the Beris lake until Gulau where you turn right to the K157. You will easily miss a small road near Kampung Landai, here are the coordinates of the junction: N05 59.64' E100 51.31' After a few hundred meters the tar road ends, park your car there, or at the junctionitself.A clear trail leads in about half an hour to the lower waterfall. In the past some development has taken place here, there still is a shelter and a bridge to cross the river. The waterfall is nice, no big pool, but a good place for bathingA small trail, to the right side of the river, continues upstream, passing several nice cascadesAfter a few hundred meters you will reach the main fall. A huge rock face. Depending on the season and the rainfall, this fall can be quite impressive.",

A bridge and walkways have been constructed across the stream, but need maintenance.Purists could discuss if this is a waterfall or a big cascade..:-) But the flow of water is impressive and the general impression is pleasant.

    "description": "The Sungei Dua is a small river coming from the main range. A biking trail of about 20 km is supposed to lead to a waterfall. A real expedition. But the river has other falls, nearer to the mainroad and relatively unknown. To find the access road is complicated, see link above for detailsWhen we asked the locals about the name of the fall, they only could tell us the name of the river. We decided to name the fall Lata Khong in honour of the founder of this website.This is a nice waterfal in beautiful surroundings, within easy reach of Kuala LumpurRecently we revisited the site and found more tiers, upstream of Lata Khong. Also the road is now tarred until the falls and in good condition. To reach the upper tiers, you don't take the steep road down, but continue for about 50-100 meters. You can park you car here. A trail goes very steeply down to the upper Sg Dua fall.Just before you you erach this fall, another vague trail splits off to the left. It is even steeper and after rain you better not try the slippery rocks. These middle falls consist themselves of several tiers. Daredevils can scramble down and reach the top of Lata Khong!Between the middle Sg Dua fall and Lata Khong ",

    "description": "This waterfall is one of the best known falls in Malaysia, because it can be seen very well from the N-S highway. But many people have never actually visited the fall, because the access road is not straightforward. Coming from KL via the N-S highway, you take the Tapah exit and continue north on the trunk road nr 1. Follow the signboards to Chenderiang. Past this village the road to the falls is clearly indicated. At the end of this raod, there are hawker stalls and you can park your car.Lata Kinjang is one of the tallest falls of Malaysia. From the highway only the middle part with the huge cascade can be seen. Cement steps bring you to a suspension bridge at the beginning of the main cascadeAt the bridge the cemented steps come to an end and so does the easy part of this waterfall. On both sides of the cascade you can climb further up, but the trail is sometimes vague and relentlessly steep. But you get a reward. At the top of the cascade there is a last, vertical fall.From the top of the cascade the view of the surrounding landscape with deep down the N-S highway, is spectacular.Spectacular viewsIt is possible to climb up further, to the delapidated pump station, but you must take care, orienteering is not always easy. To go down, you can cross the stream and find your way down. through the neglected rubber plantations. Not easy, this is Orang Asli country, there are numerous vague trails, and take care about traps! If you keep left, going down, you should come across the Lata Yuk. We almost got lost once, so take care.Archived page available ",

    "description": "When you drive from Kuala Kubu Bharu to Fraser's Hill, you will see, just after the Selangor Reservoir, a side road leading to Kg Pertak. Follow this road,through the village and park your car where the road becomes bad. There is a footbridge across a small stream. Follow the trail until you reach the ramshackle bridge over the Sg Luit. Just after this bridge the trail forks, choose either one, they join again.A few hundred meter after the Luit crossing there is a fork, where you keep left. The right trail leads to Bukit Kutu. Follow the trail along the river, you will pass an nice waterfall (Lata Jebus). After about 1.5 km there is another fork. Here you keep right, the left trail keeps following the Luit river.You leave now the Sg Luit valley, and climb up the ridge between this river and Sg Rinting. Some steep stretches, but the trail is clear and well maintained by the Temuar for access to their gardens. Only a pity that it is also used by local bikers, so some parts are heavily eroded. From the trail head it will take about 2 hours (6 km) to reach Lubuk Mecu. A huge pool invites you to take a refreshing bath. There is another fall just below Mecu, also with a nice pool. And  is only 200 m further upstream. Keep to the left of Mecu, and you will find vague trails, or just trek the river, depending on the water flow. Do NOT take a trail to the left, just before you reach Mecu, it continues uphill and does not lead to Medang.The Medang fall is quite impressive. To reach the upper tier, you must cross the river. This will not always be easy/possible, as the current can be strong! Be careful. And leave only footprints, these falls are still unspoilt, keep it that wayLata MedangThe WoM markerHere is a video of Lata Medang: ",

To reach the waterfall, take the tar road to the left just before you reach the Recreation area. After less than 1 km there is a gate where you can park your car. From there walk along the road for a few hundred meters to the fall.We liked the quiet atmosphereof Lata Mengkuang. During our visit there was not a lot of water, as it was the dry season. The waterflow will be much stronger during the monsoon.After the cascades there is one almost vertical fall with a nice pool.When you are travelling in this remote part of Kedah and have time to spare, a visit to this waterfall is highly recommended.Archived page available ",

It is only after you have climbed the steps, that you will see the signboard for the waterfall. A clear trail will lead you in a few hundred meters to the fall.The waterfall is not big, but very scenic, because the water flows down the rocks in several streams.

See this Seminyang page for details about access. The condition of the road following the Perdak river is very variable. During our visit they were busy upgrading the road, it was almost passable for normal cars. But a few weeks later after rain, the road condition had deteriorated considerably.The problem with this fall is that there is no trail down the slope to the river. You will have to find your own way down, about 2 km after the Mini Hydro Power station. Depending on where exactly you start, you will reach the river near the base of the fall OR near the top. During our visit we first went to the base.The fall is quite impressive and unspoiled, as there are hardly any visitors.Archived page available",

    "description": "The Bintang mountains, West of the main Titiwangsa range, have quite a number of waterfalls, for example Perahu and Kekabu. In between these two falls there is a relatively unknown waterfall, Lata Payung. Access is from the Kuala Kangsar-Grik road (76). Take care, coming from the South, to take the old 76 road at kg Ngor.Near Kg Kuak you turn left into small road (coordinates N4 59.70 E100 55.92) leading to a small kampung where you can park your car. It is advisable to ask for directions here, or take a guide, as the trail forks several times passing the village gardens.It is not a long hike until you enter the jungle and reach the river. This river has actually three falls, first you will reach the Bayas fall. From there keeping the river to your left, you will reach Lata Payung after a few hundred meters. The fall is quite tall and impressive. Not a big pool, but you can take a refreshing bath and shower. It is possible to climb to the top of the fall, at the left side of the river. Careful, the rocks can be slippery. From the top you are rewarded with a nice view of Lake Cenderoh, deep down.There is a third fall, not yet visited by us",

    "description": "North of Taiping and east of the Perak River runs the Bintang range, culminating at 1862 m in the Gunung Bintang, on the border between Perak and Kedah. This remote range has several known waterfalls and probably many more, which are as yet unexplored. A new road crosses the range below Ulu Jerneh. From this road two waterfalls can be reached.Coming from Batu Kerau, from far away, high up in the hills, a waterfall can be spottedThere is a fenced-off water tank near the road, where you can park your car. First we tried to find a way up from here, but the vague trail disappeared soon. We almost gave up, when we noticed a drain and a water pipe coming down to the right side of the stream. Following the drain we reached a dilapidated water catchment. From here there was no trail, but the forest was not very dense and we coud hear the sound of falling water. Climbing up the (steep!) slope, we soon arrived at the first fall.It became clear soon, that the river had split in at least two streams. After taking some rest we crossed this secondary stream and scrambled up the slope. No trail, but the roaring sound of water guided us easily to a large open space, from where we could see the main fall, that is also visible from the road below.From here we had a good view of the valley deep down. Near the fall, the spray of water soaks you within seconds. We did not see an easy way to climb further up.This is a very interesting and unspoilt series of waterfalls. Near the water tank recently a signboard has appeared, that this waterfall is the 3rd highest in South-East Asia. We were not able to trace if this information is correct and where it came from.The signboard near the water tank ",

You pass cascades and pools, suitable for families, but on weekdays you may be the only visitor.

    "description": "The Tembakah Waterfalls are probably the most impressive falls of Terengganu. The Hutan Lipur Lata Tembakah is clearly signposted and can be reached from Jertih. Coming from K. Terengganu a shortcut is possible by taking the T142 near Kg JabiThe first waterfalls are actually more like cascades. They have nice, large pools, which make them perfect for family outings. Not surprisingly, this park can be crowded!Our visit took place on a weekday, so at first we were surprised by the number of visitors. Then it became clear that nearby Kelantan was celebrating the sultan's holiday!When you follow the trail along the river, you reach the main fall of the park. It is number 4 of the list.To reach the upper falls, there are two possibities. First, you can choose the jungle trail, which is clearly signposted. The other way is to scramble upwards at the right side of the main fall. Interesting but not easy.The upper falls are also very impressive and as it takes some effort to reach them, they will be quiet even when there is a crowd.The last waterfallArchived page available ",

The Orang Asli in this village have done a wonderful job, taking care about the Penyel waterfall, which is a 10 minutes walk from the village.

    "description": "Most people know about Lata Kinjang, the waterfall that can be seen from the North-South Highway. That this waterfall has a small brother is not well known. The Lata Yuk falls are located less than 500 meters from Lata Kinjang. Just before reaching the Kinjang hawker stalls, a small road to the right leads to an Orang Asli kampung. About 500 meter after the Orang Asli village, you should reach the lower Yuk fall. This is more like a cascade. Unspoilt and no rubbish yet. Keep it that way!When we visited this fall, it was already late in the afternoon, so we had not much time to explore. There should be more cascades and falls in the upper region. This time we wanted to explore the upper reaches of Lata Yuk. It had been raining a lot and the waterfalls were powerful. We started from the Orang Asli village and soon reached the lower fall. Kids were having fun in the water. We could not find a trail along the river, so we followed first the trail to Kinjang, and then found a trail that after a while joined the Yuk river again.It ended at a few waterfalls and finally at a dam, there must have been a water reservoir in the past. On our way back, we scrambled down a steep slope and found the main cascade, a smaller version of the big Kinjang one.This time we missed the fall just above the lower fall (with the big pool), so we must come again.Part of the middle cascadeArchived page available ",

    "description": "The Lambir Hills National Park is located about 30 km south of Miri and a popular weekend destination for the Miri people.The sandstone hills rise to a height of 465m and there is an extensive trail-system (colored paint dots). Latak falls is the tallest and biggest of the waterfalls in the park. They are also the most easily accessible being only a 20 minute walk away from the Park HQ. Despite its accessibility and popularity with Miri people, Latak has the distinction of being the cleanest and most litter –free recreation site in Malaysia and comparable to the best in Europe or Australia (at least at the time of writing). Congratulations to the Park staff and local population.A visit to Latak is 3 falls for the price of 1. The walk starts at the Park kiosk and crosses over an impressively sturdy wooden bridge and then follows the side of the stream. Presently there is a temporary detour (it has been there for 3 years) until the suspension bridge is replaced. The facilities are good and, unlike some Peninsula waterfalls (e.g. Sendat), the toilets are set well back from the falls and picnic site and the litter bins are emptied regularly. Just before the second falls is the turn off (to the left) up to the observation tower and some of the other waterfalls, such as Nibong, This is also the trail to Bukit Lambir. Trails are quite wide and the signs are good however day-trippers should not attempt these unless properly equipped and shod. Unless you have experience sleeping out in the jungle at night it is best to start early in the day. Thanks to Ash for the pictures and description",

When you take the main entrance intof the park, the road crosses a small river, about 10 km before Kg Peta. This is the Sungei Lemako. Take the small dirt road just after the crossing and park your car after a few hundred meter. You will find a trail going down to the river, which you have to cross. Following the left bank of the river you will arrive at the first series of waterfalls, Takah ChapaNear the waterfalls the Orang Asli family of Pak Buyin maintains a jungle camp, where groups can stay overnight. A perfect location to enjoy the beauty of nature.Takah (meaning waterfall) Chapa is a mixture of waterfalls and cascades in several tiers. In the upper level the river splits in two streamsYou can continue after the top of the waterfalls, keeping the right bank of the river. It is advisable to use a guide. The river flows very quietly here, and there are many trails you can follow. After about 45 minutes you will reach a second set of waterfalls, This second set of falls and cascades is also very attractive. A huge pool is perfect for swimming. Apparently there is even a third set of falls, further upstream, but we had no time to explore.Takah PumungPowerful falls ",

        "The access to the Lepok Fall is part of the fun. Leaving KL and the traffic jams behind, the forest of Hulu Langat is a pleasant surprise. The small village of Hulu Langat is a good place for breakfast, before continuing to Pangsun.Just before reaching this Kampung, turn left to Lepok. This small road ends after a few km at a place where you can park your car. From here you cross a stream and start walking. This is a region of Durian orchards and bamboo forest",
        "The trek is going uphill all the time but not in a strenuous way. Pleasant forest and ginger flowers abound here.It will take about two hours to cover the 4 km to the fall, with a 350 meter gain in altitude. Generally the track is clear, don't take the sidetracks which end in Durian farmsWhen you reach a disused water pipeline, you know that you are on the right way. ",
        "The track follows more or less the pipeline until a water catchment basin is reached.From here it is not far to the waterfall",
        " It is a very attractive waterfall, with a deep pool for swimming. In nice unspoiled jungle surroundings.A perfect target for a daytrip"

You follow the road to Gunung Nuang until you see a trail to the right with a yellow signboard. Follow this trail, in the beginning it is wide and clear, later you have to follow the yellow ribbon markers.After about one hour trekking you reach the Lolo river. Keep following the markers, a few times you have to cross the river. About half an hour later you arrive at the Bomoh Ali fall, with a nice big pool. A rope hangs down from a tree, so you can play Tarzan..:-)The trail continues, you have to climb a steep slope with the help of a rope. A few hundred meters further you can hear the Berembun fall, but it is not yet visible. You have to swim, climb slippery rocks, then you will find it around the corner. This is not a place to be when there is a risk of flash floods!The Berembun waterfallAfter Berembun the trail goes on and soon you reach the junction with the Gunung Nuang trail. From here it is an easy walk back (about two hours) to the ranger station. Archived page available ",

    "description": "The Bernam river forms the boundary between Selangor and Perak. There are many tributaries, all originating from the main range around Gunung Semangkok. The Sg Lubuk Kawah is one of them, it flows into the Sg Perah, which in its turn feeds the Bernam river. Both rivers have waterfalls. Access would be difficult if not for the existence of minor roads along the Bernam river. One of these roads leads to the Teretak resort, where you can park your car. It is advisable to use a guide for the trek to the waterfalls. Contact us for more info.The first part of the trek follows a small road. The trail continues through bamboo forest and you have to cross a river. After about one hour you will reach a river crossing, where 4WD's can cross the Bernam river. It is one of the disadvantages of the Ulu Bernam region that it is a playground for 4WD's. Of course there are exceptions, but often they have little respect for nature. After trekking for one more hour you reach the confluence of the Perah and the Lubuk Kawah river, from where it is not far to the Lubuk Kawah fall.The Lubuk Kawah fall is a beautiful fall in a pristine location. Be careful when you take a bath here, the currents are strong. There is a nice, safe campsite, not far from the river. There should be more waterfalls upstream. You can river trek down to the confluence with the Perah river, where there is another waterfall. Take care, the rocks can be slippery!Sg Perah fall ",

The name Lubuk Timah suggest that the water was used for tin mining. The reservoir is completely silted now, and the water spills over the dam at both sides, creating two waterfalls. Access to the falls is from the new Simpang Pulai - C.H. road. Turn left where power lines cross the road. There is a small sign 'Lubuk Timah'.After less than one km, you are near the river where you can park your car. First you will pass an Air Panas (Hot Springs), surprisingly close to the river. From there it is only a few hundred meter to the dam and the falls.This is a popular weekend destination. You can climb up to the reservoir, which is completely silted.A recent picture.

Turn towards Lahad Datu and just drive straight.You will pass by palm oil estates on both sides with Sime Darby Plantation the most visible one. It takes about 40 minutes of driving to reach the junction to Kunak town. Don't turn into Kunak town!! Just keep going straight and head towards Lahad Datu. Ten minutes later, on your right you will see Pusat Sejadi Hutan Simpan Madai Baturong Kunak.Pay an entrance fee of RM2.00 and a short walk down the staircase will bring you to the awesome Madai Fall. The park is quite small but well maintained with restroom and shower facilities.It can get crowded during weekends because of the easy accessibility. The water is brownish in colour, however the source of the waterfall is clean and clear. The pool size is not too big - suitable for picnics with young kids but near the drop it is quite deep.Try to get behind the waterfall because it's an amazing sight with the water curtain and the green moss behind. You can walk around the pool to get there or simply swim. ",

    "description": "Leaving Tambunan in the direction of Ranau, you will reach Kg Patau after 10 or 15 minutes and see a sign post indicating a left turn to the Mahua Waterfall. (If you come from Kota Kinabalu, it would be about a 1 ½ hour ride). After making that turn, you trundle along a dirt road for 6 km. The first stretch of the road is in relatively good condition, but it gets trickier the farther in you go. My guess is that an ordinary car would encounter difficulties in wet weather. We were in a 4WD, but because it was not one of those rugged 4 x 4 work horses, we did experience some sticky moments. Eventually, we came to a large clearing along which a river rushed. This marked the end of the road. The track was rather muddy and to avoid getting our vehicle stuck, we walked the rest of the way in to the Mahua Sub-station which had been financed by the Japan International Co-operational Agency (JICA). A friendly caretaker there maintains an office and collects an entrance fee of RM3 per person. For that fee, you also get to use the extremely clean toilets. The 500 metre walk along a distinct and well-maintained trail to the waterfall is an extremely pleasant stroll through a secondary forest of dipterocarp trees, undergrowth, ferns, shrubs and bamboo dense enough to shut out most of the sun’s heat. Butterflies, mainly the Tufted Jungle King, fluttering along the trail added flashes of colour to the otherwise intense green of the forest.Two tributaries, the Sg Lobou and the Sg Kulanggi gush down as little waterfalls of their own to join the main river which is never out of sight or earshot.Sungai Kulanggi At the end of the trail, the Mahua Waterfall tumbles down in an agitated vertical column of water, sending up a continuous misty spray as it crashes into the pool below. The height of the Fall is uncertain. One source puts it as 9 metres, another 15 metres and yet another 17 metres. I’m not sure, too, whether the small pool is safe for swimming but I can imagine that the strong currents stirred up by the Fall would put paid to all such intentions.Shelters and benches are provided for picnickers. There were, however, only four other people besides us that day we went. Difficulty of access has probably discouraged many people from visiting the Fall which is not a bad thing considering the difficulty of maintaining cleanliness in the face of large crowds.Several species of butterflies – a Monster Skipper, Black-Veined Mapwings, Blue Hedges, a Rajah Brooke’s Birdwing, a Red Helen and a Common Mormon – flitted about the pool area, congregating to share a drink.Although this was not a very extensive area, we surprised ourselves by spending about two hours there. Obviously, there is more to the Mahua Waterfall than what meets the eye. ",

    "description": "The Maliau basin is sometimes called \"The Lost World of Sabah\". It was discovered in 1947 from the air, but it was only in 1988 that a first expedition visited the region. Until now only 30 % of the basin has been explored. Trekking in this part of Sabah is a serious adventure. You need permission from the Yayasan Sabah and a guide. But it is worth the effort, unspoilt nature and beautiful waterfalls will be your reward.A trip to the Maliau Basin takes several days, you will stay overnight in a number of camps and you must be prepared for long jungle treks under sometimes difficult conditions. For detailed information, download this Maliau trip report, prepared by Gabriel Chong.The powerful Giluk fall can be reached from the Camel Trophy CampThe largest and most famous falls in the area are the Maliau Falls. In total, it has seven tiers but you only see the 5th & 6th tier from the ground. They can be reached by a 1.5 hour trek from the Lobah CampTwo more falls in the region are the Giluk fall and the Sabender Fall. The Giluk fall can be combined with the Takob-Akob fall, whereas the Sabender fall is a 1 hour trek from Ginseng Camp.A well deserved shower under Sabendar Falls after a long trekkingThe pictures on this page are courtesy of Gabriel Chong, the Chin Family, Stefan Kolb and Lau Nai Kwong.

All 3 falls are not very tall but do feature many interesting soaking pools.Head to Semenyih then proceed to Universal Memorial Park as the landmark. There is an alternate northern approach as well coming from Semenyih Dam but both are using the same access road.(refer ) Sections of the access road are narrow but tarred and well maintained. Normal sedan cars can travel along it all the way till the Theravada Buddhist Temple junction. Park by the side of the road without obstructing passing vehicles. There is a trail on the right going uphill around the temple. The jungle trail inside is clear but is used as a scrambler track as well. Proceed till you see a rather large river side camp on the left. Look for the trail junction on the right that heads upriver. Along the way you will pass the 1st fall, a boulder cascade.() Visitors whom are not familiar with jungle trails are advised to engage a guide. Image 1Image 2More images of Level 2 Fall are found below. To reach the upper fall proceed another ~15mins upriver.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ",

When you are coming in to town from Simpang and look towards the hills, this waterfall is very conspicuous.Follow the road to the Water Treatment plant, and park your car near an Indian temple. From here a trail leads up to the remnants of a swimming pool. Years ago, the New Club had constructed 2 medium size pools utilizing the natural mountain water, but this has fallen into disrepair.It is not very clear how to proceed from here to the waterfall itself, if possible at all. So this waterfall is still waiting to be fully explored!  Finally a Taiping friend showed us the way and it turned out te be very easy. Just before the gate to the Water Treatment Plant, a vague trail follows the fence. After a few hundred meters it becomes a small road (former access road to the fall?). This road leads in a few minutes to the fall.The water of the fall is collected in a basin, from where pipes lead to the plant. A sign warns that visitors should not bathe or swim here, because it is part of the Taiping water supply.The basin where the water is collectedIt might be possible to climb up the (steep) slope to the left of the fall. Caution is needed, the rocks are slippery.Archived page available ",

    "description": "The Lambir Hills National Park is located about 30 km south of Miri and a popular weekend destination for the Miri people. The sandstone hills rise to a height of 465m and there is an extensive trail-system (colored paint dots). There are at least 6 waterfalls in the park. Unfortunately the most popular one, Latak, is not accessible for the time being, after flash-flooding in 2004 and 2005 destroyed the access trail. During our visit we had only time to visit the small, but picturesque Pantu fall. The park can be reached easily by public transport. Admission is RM 10. There are chalets and a canteen.As the main trail is closed, you will have to follow the Inoue trail, which starts to the left of Park HQ. The trail is clearly marked and there are signboards where the trails split. It will take about one hour to reach the Pantu Fall.The trail leads through nice forest, several huge dipterocarps are still present. To reach the fall, you must descend into a ravine, with the help of ladders. Although the Sg Letik, that feeds the fall, is only a small stream, the pool is large and deep. The setting of the fall is very romantic. The other falls require more time, it would be best to stay overnight in the park. We have to come back here!Update November 2007: the trail to Latak Falls has been reopened",

    "description": "The Pelepah waterfalls are located not far from Kota Tinggi and quite popular with Singaporeans. The trail head is located just before the entrance to the well-known Kota Tinggi falls. The easiest way in would be through a palm-oil plantation, but it is not clear if the guards will let you pass. A better way is to cross the bridge over the Kiri Pelepah river and then pass an opening in the fence. Basically you should follow more or less the river until you have passed the plantation.After you have left the plantation and entered the jungle, the trail is easy to follow. Soon you will reach the first small waterfall. The Pelapah falls are a series of falls and cascades, depending on how you count, there are about twelve tiers. Several times you have to scramble up a steep slope, where fixed ropes are very helpful.The hike is very pleasant, some of the tiers have a nice pool, some or more cascades. Lots of fish in the lower pools. During rain the rocks will be slippery, take care. The many tree trunks show that after heavy rain these falls will be powerful, and as you basically trekking in a ravine, you should be careful about flash-flooding.Level 11 is the main Pelepah fall, a long cascade. There is another small fall at the top of this cascade, after that you can keep following the river, a pleasant walk, but no more waterfallsLevel 12 ",

Within easy reach of this bustling metroplis, there are several recreational forests (Hutan Lipur) and some attractive waterfalls. One of these Recreational Forests is Hutan Lipur Perdik.From Kg Ulu Langat you follow the road north to Pangsun. Don't follow the signs to the Gabai fall, but keep straight, until a junction with a signboard for Kg Hulu Perdik. Follow this small road until the end, where you can park your car. During our last visit we noticed a few new, but uninhabited O.A houses, built in the traditional way, without nails. A clear trail follows the small stream, which you have to cross three times. The trail is quite level. You will pass nice bamboo forests on your way.A clear trailAfter the third river crossing the trail starts to climb rather steeply. It will lead to the main fall, but there is a lower fall, which you can reach by following the river after the crossing. There are vague traces of a trail, partly you will just follow the stream. It will lead you in a short time to the lower Perdik fall. We did not try to scramble up from this lower fall, but backtracked to the river crossing and followed the path uphill, to the upper fall. The rock face is imposing, but the flow of water is not very big, except after heavy rain. There is a small pool, more for wading than for swimming. The surroundings are unspoiltWith a small pool ",

        "To reach the fall, follow the road from Karak to Kuala Pilah for about 12 kmBefore reaching the village of Telemong, the road crosses a river named Perdak. Just after the bridge, there is a turning to the right. A laterite track will take you to the fall.This track was made for the Mini Hydro Power station and its employees utilize the track to commute to work. You will be guided by the power cables to reach the Station.",

        "From the Station you still have another 3 kilometer of hike with 4 short climbs interspersed with level stretches. Continuing on the track, the next scene is that of the water catchments for the power station. A small path turns off to the right to reach into the ravine where the rapids are dammed.",
        " Continue the track. Very soon, at a point where the track is seen really leading uphill continuously, look for a trail on the right. This is a visible path on level ground heading right towards the direction of the river.",

    "description": "The famous Rainbow Fall (Air Terjun Pelangi) can be reached from Sg Lembing. In earlier days this small town was famous because of its tin mines. Now it is nice, sleepy place. There is a museum and there are plans to reopen the mines as a tourist attraction. Transport to the fall can be arranged in the town, you need a 4WD if you want to go on your own. A guide is useful, although not really needed. You have to start early, as the famous rainbow can only be seen in the morning. It is a one hour drive from the town to the trail head, followed by about 45 minutes of easy trekking to the fall.The road to the trail head is a nice one, condition is good in general, with some difficult stretches, depending on the season. Beautiful views of the Kuantan river. Halfway you will pass a resort, might be a nice place to stay overnight, but it was closed and nobody could give us more info.After about 20 km you reach the end of the road, where the trail starts with a river crossing. The trail is very well signposted and brings you in about 45 to the waterfall.The waterfall itself is not spectacular, unless after heavy rainfall. It is a tall fall, and under normal conditions the water comes down as a spray. It is this spray which results in the famous rainbow, but only when the sun is still low.In general you will not be the only visitor here, and there will be a lot of oh's and ah's, when the sun breaks through the clouds. It really is a beautiful experience. If you are lucky, you can even see the double rainbow.10.30 am Almost goneThere are more waterfalls in this region, but we had no time to explore.Archived page available ",

A few km before reaching the Damai resort, there is a small cafe where the trail starts.

From the bridge you have a clear view of the attractive fall, which has two tiers.

    "description": "Just outside Ulu Yam Baharu, a 4 km dirt road runs into the forest reserve. This road ends at a ramshackle bridge where you can park the car. From there it is a short walk to the fallsThe Sendat falls consists of two tiers. The falls are located in a very shaded forest, very suitable to have a picknick on a hot day. There are some more small cataracts.The upper part of the Sendat FallArchived page available 1. Entrance per adult is RM2 and children if Im not mistaken.2. the entry signboard says RM5 per adult for camping, but the ranger who were guarding the entrance dont accept payment for camp, they only accept entrance. We stil have to pay for entrance even though we were planning to camp. The ranger said there will be another ranger in charge of camping activities inside.3. Before we set up the camp side, we looked for the ranger who are in charge of camp activities but no where to be found. So we asked the ranger who was sitting at the toilet entrance, he said, for camp will be charge per tent RM5 per night. but since he was not the person in charge so we left and just set up our camp side.4. the camp side provided is very well maintained, camp side is on the right side of the park so its not on the waterfall side. daytime, those who with families might picnic here and use the camp side, maybe because at the waterfall side most of the time is crowded with people and less dry and flat land that are suitable for kids.5. night time, it was just us and a group of 4 wheelers camped there. and the ranger who are in charge of camp activities are no where to be found so we camped there without any fee.6. public toilet will only be open from 8am to 5pm. So if you are not so comfortable doing business in the wild or changing clothes, do it before they closed.7. Im not sure about surau on what time they will closed, I just prayed at my camp side as it was easily to be done there due to there's alot of clean, dry and flat land to pray.8. If you are expecting people selling foods and drinks there, you better not. Not all the time motorbike food seller will be there. From what I saw, there was seller who sells Sate Ikan and ice cream. So its better to bring enough foods and beverages on your own.9. even though it was nicely developed, the parking compound was pitch black during night time. No security guards or any rangers during night time. It is advisable to do rounding and check your vehicle. Theres a small land where you can park your car in the camp site, I cant explain where, but the entrance to the small land parking lot is nearby the main entrance, near the titi kayu where the rangers will collect entrance fee.10. during night time, beware of stray dogs. we saw a few times a group of stray dogs running around, howling, fighting nearby our camp side but fortunately they dont kacau us and we dont kacau them.I guess, thats it I can share for now. look forward to camp here again in near future :)",

The road to the fall leads through cultivated farmland. Until recently the fall was relatively unknown. But during our visit in 2003 the first signs were visible that this might change. Apparently it had been decided that the place should be \"developed\"Our visit in april 2005 shows the damage that has been done. The fall has become almost invisble with the massive construction of shelters, walkways, etc. A desolate and spoilt waterfall.Archived page avalaible ",

Not far after this fork you can hear a waterfall.This is , reachable via a short side trailLata JebusThe trail continues until a second fork where you keep left again, the right fork leads to Lata Medang. The trail is clear and follows the Luit river,until you reach a Lubuk with a nice pool. If you are adventurous you can trek the river from here, but there is also a recent trail.Following the trail you could easily miss the next waterfall, not large, but beautiful. Finally the trail reaches Lata Makau. A real beauty. An Olympic size pool invites for a refreshing bath.When you scramble up the slope to the right side of the fall, you can reach the next fall, around the corner. And there might be more, further upstream.Just around the corner another fall ",

    "description": "To reach the turning to the 4WD track head, use the East Coast expressway and Exit on 98 that leads to Jerantut. Turn Right on Road 98. Follow the road for 50km and turn right on Road 64. Turn left to Kuala Tahan Road. Turn right after 1km. You will see an abandoned stall (pic). Turn in to the Palm oil plantation. A road leading uphill is visible. The road is not accessable by 4WD as some irresponsible has dug a hole that it will be difficult for 4WD to cross. Hence you will have to continue on foot from there. Follow the road leading uphill. On the first split, take left. You will see marking on the split. You will need to cross 2 bridge made by logs. At the second split, you will see a vague road ahead. Take the right turn. Follow the road for less than 200meters you will reach the campsite.To head to Sg Salan waterfalls, from the campsite, go straight, there will be 2 trails. One heads to the river. Another on your left. Follow the left. And it will bring you to the other side of the river. Cross the river. Clear markings along the way. Approximately 10 mins you will find there’s marking on the right heading uphill and marking heading straight. Go straight. According to locals the marking on the right leads to a waterfall that locals name it Lata Manik. Due to time factor, we did not manage to explore further during our visit. We will keep you posted once we manage to explore this place.There will be 4 river crossings. At the last river cross, you will cross using big huge logs which fell across the river. Before crossing, take a look on the trees opposite. There’s a tree with a huge bees nest. That should be the reason why locals name it Lata Lebah (Bee’s Falls).There’s a campsite after this crossing. Take the trail on your right. Follow the trail for approximately 20 minutes. Beware of slippery rocks. After a total of 3hrs hike, the nice reward of the beautiful sight of the waterfall awaits you. There’s a double Olympic size pool at the bottom of the fall. But please do not attempt to swim. The current is very strong and the pool is very deep. Check out this video |heading_8|",

    "description": "Stong Waterfall a.k.a Jelawang Waterfall is arguably one of the tallest waterfalls in Peninsular Malaysia. It can be seen from the roadside in Dabong. From KL you take the road from Kuala Lipis to Gua Musang. Then use road D241 to Dabong. Clear signboards lead to the Park. From the park, you can hire a guide to lead you to the Top of the Waterfalls. Follow the cemented steps, and it will lead you to the lower falls. Big pool but dangerous. There’s a nice bridge in front of the waterfalls. Cross the bridge and follow the clear trail that leads to the top. It’s a one and half hour rather steep hike with some climbing at the beginning of the trail.After 45 minutes hike you will reach a shelter. A trail on the left leads to the foot of the tall waterfall. Very spectacular.Backtrack to the shelter to continue the hike to the campsite. When you reach the top, there will be a sign to welcome you to the Baha’s Camp. On your right is the trail leading to Gunung Baha, Gunung Ayam and Gunung Stong.Sunrise at the campsite. On top of the waterfall, above the clouds, an unforgettable memory! A trail leads from the campsite to the Last Waterfall. This waterfall is where the rivers from Gunung Ayam and Gunung Stong join, forming Sg Jeri and the Stong Waterfalls.

    "description": "North of Tanjung Malim several small rivers flow down from the slopes of Gunung Behrang. One of them, Sungei Sekiah, has a number of attractive waterfalls, which have been named the Strata Falls. To reach them, go to Tanjung Malim and follow the directions for Kg Behrang Hulu and Proton City. After passing Proton City, look for a junction with a signboard to Diamond Creeks, a country resort. After 3 km you will reach the gate of this resort, where you must ask the security guards permission to visit the waterfall. Continue the road until the end. Here the trail starts, first through neglected palm oil plantations.There are many trails, so finding your way can be a bit complicated. On the map a few junctions are indicated. Basically you keep the stream to your right. The wide track becomes a small trail, sometimes quite overgrown. We visited the falls two times, via different routes. First we continued the trail as far as we could, until we could hear the sound of a waterfall deep down.At our next visit we decided to follow the stream. At the second 'fork left' on the map, we went right and arrived at the stream. In the first part there were still vague traces of trails. As the stream runs more or less parallel to the trail, there are a few other places where you can start following the river. The easiest access to the river is about 250 meter further, as shown on the map, where you can actually see the river from the trail.Throughout the ages the river has eroded a deep ravine. Sometimes there was no other way than just wading through the water. This is a place to be extremely careful. Not only because the rocks are slippery, but this place is prone to flash flooding. The many remains of sometimes huge trees give an impression of how powerful and dangerous the stream can then become.River trekking is always slow. It took us more than one hour, but finally we arrived at the main Strata Fall. An impressive two-tier fall with beautiful pools. The upper falls are not more than 200 meter upstream, but we could not find an easy way to climb up from here.This beautiful set of waterfalls is still virtually unknown. The setting is pristine and trekking to the falls an adventure. Even here, however, some of the few visitors have already left a plastic bottle here, a food container there, some wrappings, etc. And it is such a simple rule:  ",

    "description": "Bako National Park, although small, is the oldest national park in Sarawak. It was gazetted as a protected area on 1st May 1957 and opened to public on 4th May 1957. It is located at the tip of the Muara Tebas Peninsula with an area of about 2727 hectares, 20 km North East from Kuching.Coming from Kuching, take Jalan Bako to the Bako Jetty. You have to register, pay the park entrance fee (RM10) & the boat fee (RM47/trip/boat or RM9/person/trip if there are 6 to 10 person). The boat ride to Bako National Park main office at Telok Asam takes about 20 minutes. Depending on the tide, you will land at a jetty, or you may have to walk along the beach. Don't forget to register at the park office.The Tajor trail is clearly signposted. After a wooden walkway through the Mangrove forest you enter the lowland jungle with a long stretch of shrubs and low vegetation. It is really hot here under the baking sun, take enough water with you!The length of the Tajor trail length is about 2.75 km, it will take 2 hours to reach the Tajor fall and the trail ends at Tajor Beach. The fall is not clearly visible from the trail, you have to trek upstream a bit. The Tajor Fall is small but attractive with a relaxing jungle scenery. The water has eroded a passageway under the rock, caused an \"overhanging ledge\" with the water freely flowing underneath the rock . There is a nice pool to dip and relax your tired limbs. Unlike many of the waterfall sites in Peninsular of Malaysia, the locals and visitors really do take care of the environment here. No human rubbish left. Try to keep it that way.",

    "description": "Unknown Endau RompinThe Endau Rompin National Park is the second largest national park in Peninsular Malaysia.Besides the main entrance, at Kg Peta, there is another entry point at Kg Selai for the southern regions of the park. In this relatively unknown part of Endau Rompin, there is a powerful waterfall, the Taka Tinggi. To reach Kg Selai, take the Yong Peng exit of the North-South Expressway, direction Labis and follow the signs for Bekok. Continue to the recreational park of Sungai Bantang, where you can organise transport to the park and guides. You can drive yourself to the base camp at Lubuk Tapah, but inside the park the tracks are bad and a 4WD is needed. After registration at the Ranger Station you will pass a few Orang Asli villages.From the Base Camp it is a 1-2 hour trek along the Selai river to reach the roaring fall. The track is well maintained and clean, difficult spots are provided with rope bridges. The fall can be heard before you see it, as it is around a corner.It is a big powerful fall, and the pool is not really inviting for a swim. To get a better view point, you have to cross the river. It is good that ropes have been provided for, otherwise it would be a risky adventure.Other Waterfalls in Endau Rompin Park (Selai)Takah Selow Fall and Takah Pandan Fall are the most popular waterfalls at Endau Rompin, Selai. Although they are easy access, you still need about 30 mins of jungle trekking to reach them. A guide is compulsory for all waterfalls in the park.The journey to  is the toughest trail in the park and packed with lots of leeches, compared with other waterfalls here. Before the body has warmed up, you have to start climbing up a steep slope. The whole journey is a lot of ups and downs. Ropes are fixed at some difficult parts .Takah BeranginTakah Tempaang ",

The misty upper level features a 2 tier cascade with a vertical drop of water into a rocky narrow riverbed. The lower level is a single drop into a large pool. A beautiful spot that is spoilt by the presence of messy piping trunks to tap water for human activities.Local resort operators may occasionally organize abseiling activities here. There have been instances where low rainfall coupled with the high amount of water being siphoned left only trickling water levels.Head to Semenyih then Broga town as the landmark. From Semenyih, visitors will pass a small bridge before approaching the access road on the left. The access road is BEFORE the Kg Baru Broga village gate.(refer ) This access will pass an orang asli village before arriving at Paradise Valley Broga Resort.There is plenty of parking space near the resort and opposite a local restaurant. Large groups are advised to be considerate and carpool instead of occupying most of the parking space as the area is popular during the weekend lunch crowd.Access trail starts from 2°56'43.0\"N 101°54'44.3\"E. Proceed on the main trail and follow the trail that pass a small cement bridge across the river. There are plenty of jungle trails here and it can be confusing.

These Teladas Falls are even properly signposted from trunk road nr 2, although that is the last sign you will see. In earlier days these falls must have been a popular and well-maintained recreation park. Now the place is rundown,shelters have fallen in disrepair and the steps leading down to the falls are broken and slippery. Follow the sign, and turn left after a few hundred meters to the Teladas government staff quarters, then turn right just before reaching them.The road passes under the Kuantan highway and ends at a place where you can park your car. From here steps lead down to a pool. Very teh tarik water, not inviting to take a bath. For the waterfalls you have to walk back a bit. There you will find ramshackle steps leading down to the falls. There is an upper and a lower fall and they are actually nice if you don't mind the color of the water.The lower tier of Teladas ",

    "description": "Templer Falls is a 2-tier waterfall with many shallow cascade pools. The lower tier has a wide sandy pool while the top tier is a tall sloped cascade fall. Templer Fall is less popular compared to the nearby Kanching Falls, as the waterfall is not straightforward and requires visitors to hike along the mostly flat terrain riverside jungle trail over multiple bridges to reach. The hike is suitable for beginners and the waterfall is well worth the effort with crystal clear waters.Head to Rawang town as the landmark. The entrance to Templer Park is on the left of Jalan Rawang southbound to KL. Look out for the large signposted entry gate () which is the junction to turn into. There are plenty of parking spaces here and on weekends the riverside park can be crowded with families having a picnic.Proceed up the stairs and inside visitors will find a large deep swimming pool.() Currently the pool is drained and it is not known if the pool will be filled back up again. On the left there is a series of stairs that will lead to the old water catchment dam where the river trail starts.There are a number of river crossings but visitors will not need to wet their feet as there are either zig-zag or straight bridges constructed in the past that still holds up to this day. The jungle trail is clear and visitors will arrive at the waterfall in less than 1 hour.Image 1Image 2The final cascades are quite tall and at the top there are a few nice bathtub like pools, perfect for a relaxing bath.Templer Fall Wide Scene\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~  ",

The Tengkil falls are a collection of falls and cascades, remote and unspoilt. Our guide counted seven tiers, but some of them are small. No big pools, but many \"bathtubs\". Lots of fishing spotsSome scrambling is needed, but in general it is a very pleasant hike. During our visit the water flow was reduced, as it had not been raining for several days.

    "description": "The Slim river is a major tributary of the Bernam river, with its origins in the main Titiwangsa Range. It has a reputation for wild water rafting. And there is a waterfall, which can only be reached by a 4WD. To reach this waterfall, take the Slim River exit from the N-S highway and follow the signs to Kg Slim. From here follow the road to the desolate Ulu Slim Hot Springs. Here the tar road ends. Gradually the condition of the road becomes worse and a 4WD is needed.Not only the road conditions gets worse, also there is a confusing number of junctions and forks. Luckily every now and then you will meet Orang Asli who can show you the way to Kg Tibang. Because that is the Orang Asli kampung from where you can reach the waterfall.Finally... Pos TibangIn the kampung we met friendly Orang Asli, who were willing to guide us further. We could continue for a short distance by car, then we really had to walk and fight the many leeches.The Tibang fall is a vertical fall, not very tall, but unspoilt and peaceful. The falling water forms a nice pool, inviting for a swim. Not easy to reach this fall, but worth the effortNice swimmingpool ",

The road until Kg Senta is in good condition, but for the next 8 km to Pos Gedong you need a 4WD. At  you will pass a small waterfall, , located just beside the road.Lata SentaThere are several difficult stretches, the road condition will depend on the weather, and you have to cross the river. A few hundred meters before reaching Pos Gedong there is nice waterfall, , not far from the road () You can ask for a guide in pos Gedong.Lata SerolPos GedongFrom Pos Gedong a former logging road leads you to a ridge which you have to follow for several hours, after which you must river trek the last km to the fall. Better to arrange for a guide in Pos Gedong, and camp overnight there, it is a long trek and you have to climb a lot, as the fall is located at an altitude of more than 700 m.And finally river trekkingAs this fall is not often visited, there is no real trail along the river. Parang needed and a lot of chopping. You will pass another small waterfall and then the louder and louder sound of falling water indicates that you have finally arrived at the Tigok fall.The Tigok fall is quite spectacular and powerful, and also completely unspoilt. Please keep it that way, do not leave ANY rubbish behind. Just enjoy nature. And be prepared for a long and tiring trek back.... This is a remote fall",

Upstream in the same river the famous Buaya Sangkut fall can be found, but the Upeh Guling falls are also interesting and worth of a visit.A visit of the fall starts at Kampung Peta, the main entrance of the park. From the jetty you must go by boat on the Endau river to , the junction with the Jasin river.Kuala JasinFrom Kuala Jasin a clear trail starts along the river. Several times the river has to be crossed, either on hanging bridges, or just by wading through the stream. It will take about one hour to reach Kuala Marong, from where it is another half hour to the waterfalls.The Upeh Guling falls are a mix of waterfalls and cascades. The trail ends near the top of the falls, where you can just walk on the rocks to the pools and falls. A perfect place for a picnic and a bathVery characteristic for Upeh Guling are the many potholes, eroded in hundreds of thousands of years by the force of water and stones, swirling around.Perfect place to relax ",

        "More than three years ago, in December 2006, I have made a trip to the Kelabit Highlands  in Sarawak. During my stay in the friendly Apple lodge in Ba' Kelalan, I found in the guesthouse library a book, \"The National Parks of Sarawak\", by Hans Hazebroek (a Dutchman ?).",

        "\nBack home, I continued collecting information. I found an Internet link to a trip, organised by the Miri HHH, many years ago. I heard the story about the Millionaire's club, a failed project to \"develop\" the Usun Apau plateau with a golf course and a luxury resort.\n",
        "\nA few months later I met Ashleigh, who had been traveling a lot in Sarawak, knew about the Julan fall and was interested to organise a MNS trip to the Usun Apau plateau.\n",

        "The Usun Apau plateau",
        "\nThe Usun Apau plateau is located about 170 km SSE of Miri. It is an old volcanic plateau, near the Indonesian border, unknown until 1951, when Tom Harrison, the curator of the Sarawak Museum in Kuching, discovered it. The plateau is basically uninhabited because of its inaccessibility, with steep slopes, giving rise to spectacular waterfalls.On the north side of the plateau the Julan river and one of its tributaries form the Julan falls, before joining the Baram river. At the south side it is the Selio river with its tributaries, which flows in the Silat river and finally in the Baram river.\nThe highest point of the plateau is formed by Bukit Selidang, the remnant of an old volcano.\n\n\n",
        "The Usun Apau plateau. A number of waterfalls is indicated, there must be many more. The Julan and Selio rivers are indicated in light-blue. The Selio river flows into the Silat river and finally in the Baram river. There are many more rivers originating on the plateau, but not shown on this map.",
        "The Julan Falls",
        "Eastern Julan Fall",
        "The problem with the Julan falls is that there are more than one, and this can (and has!) lead to some confusion.When Dato Jacob Sagan started a project for a high-class resort on the plateau (the Millionaire's Club), he arranged for a professional photographer to take aerial pictures of the two main falls, from a helicopter. They are shown to the left and right. The one depicted in the National Parks of Sarawak book, is the Western Julan fall. The Eastern fall is located at a distance of about 3 km. It is actually a tributary of the Julan river and less powerful than the Western one",
        "\nThe Millionaire's Club was planned a few km away from the Western Fall. Construction started in 1984, but due to the economical situation, it was never completed. Not everybody was unhappy about this \"failure\", there were environmental concerns that the project might damage the pristine and unspoilt character of the Usun Apau plateau. See for example a report by Ashleigh or this report by Lelan.",

His report, \"the Highest Waterfall Drop in Sarawak\", can be found here\nThe picture below left, shows the top of the fall, with the water falling down vertically.\nA few months later, the Miri HHH group organised an expedition, not only to the Western fall, but even to the mountain Bukit Selidang, about 17 km south of the Julan fall!. A report of this expedition, again guided by Morrison, can be found here \nThe Miri Hashers wrote an instructive report about this expedition,full of useful hints and advice,  which can no longer be found on their own website but is available here, courtesy of the  Miri HHH webmaster Ray Stringer.",

    "description": "Hidden treasure on the slopes of Gunung BelumutThe water from the river is crystal clear and there were quite a number of visitors. You can follow a path along the stream for some distance. It is also possible to climb the mountain from here (guide compulsory).But there is more to see! We had heard about the Sg Yong falls nearby, and a stall owner could give us accurate directions. Not easy to find! After about 15 km from the main road, you will pass a bridge. Just after the bridge, do not turn right to the Park but go straight for 3.81 km, through palm oil plantations. Park your car and take the clear trail to the right.The Sg Yong falls consist of seven tiers. The falls go down a narrow gorge. Extreme care has to be taken, because the rocks are quite slipperyAs we visited these falls late in the afternoon, we had no time to visit all the tiers. It will be worth while to come back and explore the upper falls.At the Belumut Park, we were told that there are plans to open up these falls. So better hurry, so you can enjoy this pristine falls, before it is too late!Contributed by Faye: The campsite is not accessible by 4wd anymore. Someone dug a deep wide drainage across the dirt trail at the border of oil palm plantation. A electric parameter fence had been build around the oil palm plantation too. Followed the vague track on the right of the stream towards upper stream. Got to be very careful, as you need to cross a wet slippery rock surfaceUpper Tier ",
