  "name": "Kenyir falls",
  "description": "The Kenyir Lake in Terengganu, created in 1985, is the largest man-made lake in South East Asia. Numerous rivers and streams feed the lake, and many have waterfalls. To visit them you need a boat and for some of them also a permit. Main starting point for trips is the Pengkalan Gawi jetty.The only waterfall that can be reached over land, only a few km from the jetty and beside the road.This is the waterfall closest to Pengkalan Gawi, less than half an hour by boat. The jetty makes it easy to board and it is only a short walk to the waterfall.The most powerful and popular waterfall of Tasik Kenyir. Can be crowded because almost all tour packages will include it in their program. Access from a jetty via a short trail, but most boats land where the river flows into the lake, from where it is a short scramble to the multi-tiered fall. There is a suspension bridge with a good view of the falls and als an observation tower. Upstream of the top fall there is a campsite, but the walkway is broken. Click here for a video clip of Lasir.Not many people will visit this small, attractive waterfall, not far from busy Lasir. Where the stream flows into the lake, a nice jacuzzi invites for a refreshing bath.Further south on Lake Kenyir there are two remote ranger outposts, because here you are bordering Taman Negara. One of them is the floating Pos Sg Petani, near the mouth of the Sg Petani. From here you can visit a Kelah sanctuary, where the fish will nibble your body, a fun experience. There are also two waterfalls, both directly flowing in the lake. Still further south is Pos Mentong, the most remote location in Tasik Kenyir and an entrance of Taman Negara. You need a permit. There are limestone caves around.Probably also more cascades and (small) waterfalls, like the pristine Jeram KetapangThere are also waterfalls in the Northern part of Tasik Kenyir, no time to visit them yetArchived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
