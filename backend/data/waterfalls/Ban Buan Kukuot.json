This is the region where the Bidayuh live, no longer in longhouses, but in attractive kampungs. One of these is Kg Sadir, on the slopes of the Penrissen range. There are several waterfalls near this kampung.The easiest way to reach Kg Sadir from Kuching, is to follow first the signage to the Semenggoh Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre and then to the Borneo Highlands Resort. Finally to Kg Sadir, where the road ends and you can park your car. The road quality is ok, except for some potholes.Two waterfalls, Skedu and Ban Buan Sadir are quite close to the kampung. For the other two, Ban Buan Kukuot and Mabi, some trekking is needed. As there are many trails used by the farmers to reach their padi fields, it is a good idea to arrange for a guide in the kampung.  is located very near to the village.
