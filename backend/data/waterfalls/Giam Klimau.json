{"name":"Giam Klimau","description":"Batu Niah town, located about 85km from Miri city, is a rest stop between Miri and Bintulu. Everyone knows about the famous gigantic Niah Caves. But not many people (not even the Niah NP staff) would expect that waterfalls can be found here.Somewhere in the remote area of oil palm plantations, there are a lot of waterfalls waiting to be discovered. Giam Klimau is one of them. In Bidayuh language ‘giam’ means waterfall or rapid. Access to the fall is through an oil palm plantation. The bumpy terrain is not that easy for a sedan car,a 4WD and a guide are advisable. The oil palm plantation is under private company, you will have to report at several security check points. It will take about 30mins driving (15km) to reach the trail head. There is a visible trail leading to waterfall, it is just a short walk through the bushes.Giam Klimau has an amazing geographical feature. It is a curtain fall! The water just drops on the hard rock surface instead of a pool. The pool is several meters away. The most amazing thing is the upper hard rock layer, protruding and forming a sheltered place underneath. When you stand inside, you can hear the water flowing above the rock layer. You wonder how this landscape can be formed, by corrosion? Nature is awesome.","state":"Sarawak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N3 43.39 E113 55.64","verbatimLatitude":"N3 43.39","verbatimLongitude":"E113 55.64","decimalLatitude":3.72317,"decimalLongitude":113.92733,"decimalCoordinates":"3.72317,113.92733"},"coordinates":"N3 43.39 E113 55.64","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Curtain Fall","accessibility":"4WD","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TN_7016817.jpg","TNUntitled-1.jpg","TN_7016820.jpg","TN_7016824.jpg","TN_7016834.jpg","TN_7016842.jpg","TN_7016843.jpg","TN_7016849.jpg","TN_7016885.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016817.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TNUntitled-1.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016820.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016824.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016834.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016842.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016843.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016849.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/143klimau/tn/TN_7016885.jpg"],"imgDesc":["You have to pass several security checkpoints ","Walking through the bushes","Above the fall","The fall from far away","A closer look","You can walk across the fall easily","The main fall","The side fall","Under the shelter","Text and pictures have been contributed by Faye.
