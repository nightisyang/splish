      "Gunung Ledang, formerly know as Mount Ophir is with a height of 1276 m the highest mountain in the state of Johore. To climb this mountain you need permission from the Park HQ, where you also can hire a (compulsory) guide . There are many legends about the Princess (Puteri) of Gunung Ledang, click here",
      "The Puteri Fall is named after this legendary Princess. The fall is located on the lower slopes of the mountain which are easily accessible by a cemented walkway.They attract a big crowd, especially during weekends.Nice swimmingpools and picknick places in a surrounding of imposing tropical forest.",
      "The Puteri Fall itself is more a cascade, about 60 m tall.As the cascade is curved, it is not really possible to get a complete view of it.Not spectacular, but an attractive place to spend a lazy Sunday.",
      "At the top of the cascade there is another small fall, with a nice swimmingpool. Don't expect to be alone here during a weekend!The cemented walkway ends here, and the real climbing of the mountains starts. There is another, smaller waterfall, along the trail to the top.",
      "The small waterfall at the top of the Puteri cascade",
      "Weekend Fun. Don't expect to be alone here."
