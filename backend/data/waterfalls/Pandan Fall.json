Or follow the old highway, take the road to Panching. Halfway there is a junction for the waterfall. See the detailed map","This is a well maintained and clean recreation park. There are good facilties, shelters, food stalls. A suspension bridge spans the river. It is only a short walk from the car park to the beautiful waterfall.","No wonder that this place is well visited, especially during weekends. During our visit the water volume was quite small, but you can imagine how different that will be in the rainy season! The pool is very suitable for bathing and wading.","It is possible to climb up at the left side of the fall. Be careful with slippery rocks at the top of the fall","To avoid accidents, the top of the fall has been fenced off. But the fence should be more solid .","At the top of the fall the stream continues in a very quiet way. Really one single fall!","Update May 2007"," During a recent visit we noticed that a lot of landscaping had taken place. And there was a lot more water this time,quite impressive","Nice landscaping has taken place"],"imgFullResFilename":["pandan02.jpg","IMG_4208.jpg","pandan06.JPG","P5160218.JPG","pandan09.JPG","pandan01.JPG","pandan00.gif","pandan07.JPG","pandan03.JPG","pandan08.JPG","pandan04.JPG","pandan05.JPG"]},"url":"17pandan.php"}
