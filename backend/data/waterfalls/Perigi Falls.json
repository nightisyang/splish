{"name":"Perigi Falls","description":"Gunung Jerai is an isolated mountain near the sea, north of Sg Petani. The mountain is 1218 m high and has a number of (seasonal) waterfalls. The Perigi Falls can be reached from Yan Kecil and are visible from far awayThe Perigi Falls consist of two falls/cascades. There is no clear trail up, but in the dry season it is safe to climb the rocks. Be careful, however, wet rocks are slipperyWhat makes the Perigi Falls interesting is the splendid view of the sea and the rice fields of Kedah. We found no way to climb up the second fall. These falls will be much more impressive during the monsoon seasonArchived page available","state":"Kedah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"5.8088049, 100.407404","verbatimLatitude":"5.8088049","verbatimLongitude":"100.407404","decimalLatitude":5.8088,"decimalLongitude":100.4074,"decimalCoordinates":"5.8088,100.4074"},"coordinates":"5.8088049, 100.407404","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical falls","accessibility":"From carpark","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNperigi01.JPG","TNperigi02.JPG","TNperigi03.JPG","TNperigi04.JPG","TNperigi05.JPG","TNperigi06.JPG","TNperigi07.JPG","TNperigi08.JPG","TNperigi09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/73perigi/tn/TNperigi09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The signboard at Yan Kecil","After about 3 km the road ends at the lower fall.","In the dry season there is not much water","During the monsoon, this will be a real fall.","This is the only waterfall, as far as we know, with a view of the sea.","At the top of the first fall there are nice pools where you can take a bath.","After the first fall the slope of the rock face is less","There are some more quiet pools","Then there is the second fall, more impressive than the first one"],"imgFullResFilename":["perigi02.JPG","perigi01.JPG","perigi04.JPG","perigi06.JPG","perigi07.JPG","gunungjerai00.gif","perigi09.JPG","perigi05.JPG","perigi08.JPG","perigi03.JPG"]},"url":"73perigi.php"}
