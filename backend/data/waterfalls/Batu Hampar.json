{"name":"Batu Hampar","description":"There are several places around Gunung Jerai with the name Batu Hampar. This Recreation Park can be reached easily from Yan. Just outside Yan there is a junction where you take right to Batu Hampar. The falls are not spectacular but the stream is nice and quiet.A trail leads to a few small, but pleasant waterfalls. We visited the place during the dry season, during the monsoon the water flow will be bigger.","state":"Kedah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N05 46.52' E100 24.13'","verbatimLatitude":"N05 46.52'","verbatimLongitude":"E100 24.13'","decimalLatitude":5.77533,"decimalLongitude":100.40217,"decimalCoordinates":"5.77533,100.40217"},"coordinates":"N05 46.52'  E100 24.13'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Several small falls, cascades","accessibility":"Recreation Park","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNbatuhampar01.JPG","TNbatuhampar02.JPG","TNbatuhampar03.JPG","TNbatuhampar04.JPG","TNbatuhampar05.JPG","TNbatuhampar06.JPG","TNbatuhampar07.JPG","TNbatuhampar08.JPG","TNbatuhampar09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/95batuhampar/tn/TNbatuhampar09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The signboard just outside Yan","The entrance of the Recreation Park","Stairs lead down to the stream where there are shelters and picknick places","One of the small falls","A nice place to spend a lazy day","A natural slide","Life is not bad on a day like this","A small fall, but a nice big pool.","A quiet, peaceful atmosphere."],"imgFullResFilename":["gunungjerai00.gif","batuhampar08.JPG","batuhampar01.JPG","batuhampar06.JPG","batuhampar03.JPG","batuhampar02.JPG","batuhampar09.JPG","batuhampar07.JPG","batuhampar04.JPG","batuhampar05.JPG"]},"url":"95batuhampar.php"}
