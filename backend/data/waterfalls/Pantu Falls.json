{"name":"Pantu Falls","description":"The Lambir Hills National Park is located about 30 km south of Miri and a popular weekend destination for the Miri people. The sandstone hills rise to a height of 465m and there is an extensive trail-system (colored paint dots). There are at least 6 waterfalls in the park. Unfortunately the most popular one, Latak, is not accessible for the time being, after flash-flooding in 2004 and 2005 destroyed the access trail. During our visit we had only time to visit the small, but picturesque Pantu fall. The park can be reached easily by public transport. Admission is RM 10. There are chalets and a canteen.As the main trail is closed, you will have to follow the Inoue trail, which starts to the left of Park HQ. The trail is clearly marked and there are signboards where the trails split. It will take about one hour to reach the Pantu Fall.The trail leads through nice forest, several huge dipterocarps are still present. To reach the fall, you must descend into a ravine, with the help of ladders. Although the Sg Letik, that feeds the fall, is only a small stream, the pool is large and deep. The setting of the fall is very romantic. The other falls require more time, it would be best to stay overnight in the park. We have to come back here!Update November 2007: the trail to Latak Falls has been reopened","state":"Sarawak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N04 12.15' E114 01.72'","verbatimLatitude":"N04 12.15'","verbatimLongitude":"E114 01.72'","decimalLatitude":4.2025,"decimalLongitude":114.02867,"decimalCoordinates":"4.2025,114.02867"},"coordinates":"N04 12.15'  E114 01.72'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Vertical Fall","accessibility":"Trekking from carpark","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNlambir01.JPG","TNlambir02.JPG","TNlambir03.JPG","TNlambir04.JPG","TNlambir05.JPG","TNlambir06.JPG","TNlambir07.JPG","TNlambir08.JPG","TNlambir09.JPG","TNlambir10.jpg","TNlambir11.jpg","TNlambir12.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir09.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir10.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir11.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/109lambir/tn/TNlambir12.JPG"],"imgDesc":["The signboard for Lambir Hills","Six waterfalls, but part of the park is closed to the public.","The main trail is closed, it is not clear for how long.","The start of the Inoue trail","A beautiful Stinkhorn along the path","The signage is very clear, from here it is 151 (!) m to the fall","An impressive, very tall dipterocarp","Climbing down to the fall using ladders","The Pantu waterfall","Romantic setting","A strange column, that you would rather expect in a cave","The perfect shower!"],"imgFullResFilename":["lambir00.gif","lambir02.JPG","lambir05.JPG","lambir08.JPG","lambir04.JPG","lambir10.jpg","lambir09.JPG","lambir11.jpg","lambir12.JPG","lambir01.JPG","lambir03.JPG","lambir07.JPG","lambir06.JPG"]},"url":"109lambir.php"}
