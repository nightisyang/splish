In several places sturdy bridges have been built across the stream","\n\t","At the top of the first cascades a first bridge is built","A view back under the bridge at the first cascades","Youngsters try to catch fish under the rocks","The second waterfall just before you reach the second bridge","This waterfall has a nice pool, but the slopes are too steep.
