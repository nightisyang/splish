{"name":"Lata Batu Pecah","description":"Trekking to  is easy, but reaching the trail head may take some time. This waterfall is located in the Gunung Bubu range, about 25 km West of Ipoh. Quite close, but to reach it, you have to cross the mighty Perak river, either near Kuala Kangsar, or near Parit. Either way, you have to aim for the small village of Manong. About 3 km north of Manong at coordinates N4 37.18 E100 52.29, you take a minor road to the left. Follow this road until you reach an open field where you can park your car. It is a campsite with a stream nearby where you can take a bath.From here you follow a logging road which crosses the stream at a small waterfallAfter about 1.5 km a small trail leaves the logging road and forks right. From here it is not far to the Batu Pecah waterfall.Lata Batu PecahA few hundred meters upstream there is another waterfall, quite powerful, but difficult to reach as there is no trail. As we do not know the name, we have baptised it Lata Naga Air","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N4 37.27 E100 50.86","verbatimLatitude":"N4 37.27","verbatimLongitude":"E100 50.86","decimalLatitude":4.62117,"decimalLongitude":100.84767,"decimalCoordinates":"4.62117,100.84767"},"coordinates":"N4 37.27 E100 50.86","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical Fall","accessibility":"Trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_1089.JPG","TNIMG_1027.JPG","TNIMG_1088.JPG","TNIMG_1035.JPG","TNIMG_1039.JPG","TNIMG_1069.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1089.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1027.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1088.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1035.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1039.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/156batupecah/tn/TNIMG_1069.JPG"],"imgDesc":["A dam in the stream has created a nice pool","A small waterfall","Wide logging road","Lata Batu Pecah","An attractive waterfall","Lata Naga Air"],"imgFullResFilename":["batupecah00.JPG","IMG_1035.JPG","IMG_1088.JPG","IMG_1027.JPG","IMG_1069.JPG","IMG_1089.JPG","IMG_1039.JPG"]},"url":"156batupecah.php"}
