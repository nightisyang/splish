{"name":"Lata Puteh","description":"North of Taiping and east of the Perak River runs the Bintang range, culminating at 1862 m in the Gunung Bintang, on the border between Perak and Kedah. This remote range has several known waterfalls and probably many more, which are as yet unexplored. A new road crosses the range below Ulu Jerneh. From this road two waterfalls can be reached.Coming from Batu Kerau, from far away, high up in the hills, a waterfall can be spottedThere is a fenced-off water tank near the road, where you can park your car. First we tried to find a way up from here, but the vague trail disappeared soon. We almost gave up, when we noticed a drain and a water pipe coming down to the right side of the stream. Following the drain we reached a dilapidated water catchment. From here there was no trail, but the forest was not very dense and we coud hear the sound of falling water. Climbing up the (steep!) slope, we soon arrived at the first fall.It became clear soon, that the river had split in at least two streams. After taking some rest we crossed this secondary stream and scrambled up the slope. No trail, but the roaring sound of water guided us easily to a large open space, from where we could see the main fall, that is also visible from the road below.From here we had a good view of the valley deep down. Near the fall, the spray of water soaks you within seconds. We did not see an easy way to climb further up.This is a very interesting and unspoilt series of waterfalls. Near the water tank recently a signboard has appeared, that this waterfall is the 3rd highest in South-East Asia. We were not able to trace if this information is correct and where it came from.The signboard near the water tankCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
