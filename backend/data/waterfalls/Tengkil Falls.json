{"name":"Tengkil Falls","description":"A remote fall on the slopes of the Gunung Muntahak, the same range where the well-known Kota Tinggi falls are located. From Kota Tinggi you take the road to the falls until Kg Batu Empat, where you turn left (nr 91) until you reach Petri Jaya. From here you first follow an oil plantation road, then a logging road through a kind of desert until you finally reach the jungle and the Tengkil river. You will need a guide. The Tengkil falls are a collection of falls and cascades, remote and unspoilt. Our guide counted seven tiers, but some of them are small. No big pools, but many \"bathtubs\". Lots of fishing spotsSome scrambling is needed, but in general it is a very pleasant hike. During our visit the water flow was reduced, as it had not been raining for several days. After heavy rain, it must be a very impressive series of waterfalls. The mainfall is almost vertical and quite spectacular.Very photogenicCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
