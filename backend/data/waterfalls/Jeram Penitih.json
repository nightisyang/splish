{"name":"Jeram Penitih","description":"The Penitih waterfalls are located in a remote region between the Coastal Highway 3 and the Inland Highway 14. Follow the signs for Bandar Seri Bandi.A signboard tells you where the plantation road to the waterfalls starts. During our visit the palm oil plantation was being rejuvenated, giving the landscape a desolate outlook. The road quality was reasonable, but a 4WD is advisable.After another 2 km through secondary jungle, the road ends at the Penitih stream. A clear trail follows the river, which you have to cross several times. The water is extremely clear. A pleasant 15 minute walk brings you to the first waterfall.Continuing the trail you will hear the small second fall (not easy to reach) and in about ten minutes you will arrive at the beautiful third fall. Pristine surroundings.There was no time to explore further upstream where there should be (many)more falls. The third fall is at an altitude of 140 m only, while the river has its origins at Bukit Kundur (565 m)","state":"Terengganu","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N 04 26.87' E 103 21.64'","verbatimLatitude":"N 04 26.87'","verbatimLongitude":"E 103 21.64'","decimalLatitude":4.44783,"decimalLongitude":103.36067,"decimalCoordinates":"4.44783,103.36067"},"coordinates":"N 04 26.87'  E 103 21.64'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Multiple falls","accessibility":"4WD and trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNDSC_0821.JPG","TNDSC_0811.JPG","TNP1290003.JPG","TNDSC_0810.JPG","TNDSC_0806.JPG","TNDSC_0780.JPG","TNDSC_0805.JPG","TNDSC_0784.JPG","TNDSC_0786.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0821.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0811.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNP1290003.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0810.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0806.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0780.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0805.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0784.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/135penitih/tn/TNDSC_0786.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Signboard at the beginning of the plantation road.","A desolate landscape","Finally, the start of the jungle","A pleasant river walk ","The first waterfall","With a few local visitors","The third fall","With a beautiful pool","View from the side"],"imgFullResFilename":["Capture.jpg","DSC_0810.JPG","DSC_0821.JPG","DSC_0806.JPG","DSC_0811.JPG","DSC_0784.JPG","DSC_0780.JPG","P1290003.JPG","DSC_0805.JPG","DSC_0786.JPG"]},"url":"135penitih.php"}
