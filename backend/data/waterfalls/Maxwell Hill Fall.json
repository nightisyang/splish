{"name":"Maxwell Hill Fall","description":"Taiping, famous for its Lake Garden and Maxwell Hill, also has a waterfall. When you are coming in to town from Simpang and look towards the hills, this waterfall is very conspicuous.Follow the road to the Water Treatment plant, and park your car near an Indian temple. From here a trail leads up to the remnants of a swimming pool. Years ago, the New Club had constructed 2 medium size pools utilizing the natural mountain water, but this has fallen into disrepair.It is not very clear how to proceed from here to the waterfall itself, if possible at all. So this waterfall is still waiting to be fully explored!  Finally a Taiping friend showed us the way and it turned out te be very easy. Just before the gate to the Water Treatment Plant, a vague trail follows the fence. After a few hundred meters it becomes a small road (former access road to the fall?). This road leads in a few minutes to the fall.The water of the fall is collected in a basin, from where pipes lead to the plant. A sign warns that visitors should not bathe or swim here, because it is part of the Taiping water supply.The basin where the water is collectedIt might be possible to climb up the (steep) slope to the left of the fall. Caution is needed, the rocks are slippery.Archived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
