{"name":"Teladas Falls","description":"Many waterfall lovers will have passed Maran on their way to Berkelah and Jerangkang without realising that this village has waterfalls itself, very close by. These Teladas Falls are even properly signposted from trunk road nr 2, although that is the last sign you will see. In earlier days these falls must have been a popular and well-maintained recreation park. Now the place is rundown,shelters have fallen in disrepair and the steps leading down to the falls are broken and slippery. Follow the sign, and turn left after a few hundred meters to the Teladas government staff quarters, then turn right just before reaching them.The road passes under the Kuantan highway and ends at a place where you can park your car. From here steps lead down to a pool. Very teh tarik water, not inviting to take a bath. For the waterfalls you have to walk back a bit. There you will find ramshackle steps leading down to the falls. There is an upper and a lower fall and they are actually nice if you don't mind the color of the water.The lower tier of TeladasCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
