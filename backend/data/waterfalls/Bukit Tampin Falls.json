{"name":"Bukit Tampin Falls","description":"s is a series of rocky cascade falls with the main fall at the lower level. Upper levels are some small to mid sized cascades that ends at the old water catchment dam. Water quality is decent but there are some visible signs of human trash washed down from upriver along the stream.Bukit Tampin FallHead to Tampin town as the landmark. At the end of Jalan Ametis Utama there is a right junction going uphill to Gunung Tampin.() There is an open space clearing on the right for visitors to park.Follow the tar road trail for about 600meters and near the rest hut on the left there is a hill trail used in the past for construction of transmission towers. A few hundred meters in and the trail will reach a river crossing. Scramble upriver and the fall will be in sight.Image 1There are some smaller cascades upriver but no trail. It is mostly river trekking and the forest vegetation can be quite wild. Close to the end near the old water catchment dam there is a section of steep soil erosion as well. Photos below.Exploration Notes : Nothing interesting found upriver. Rocky boulders & underground river beyond old catchment dam. \"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ","state":"Negeri Sembilan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"2.48727, 102.22151","verbatimLatitude":"2.48727","verbatimLongitude":"102.22151","decimalLatitude":2.48727,"decimalLongitude":102.22151,"decimalCoordinates":"2.48727,102.22151"},"coordinates":"2.48727, 102.22151","waterSource":"Sg. ???, Natural Stream","waterfallProfile":"Boulder Cascade","accessibility":"Trekking, <30 mins","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNbkttampinfallfullweb.jpg","TNscreenshot(879).png","TNf7183ab4ade34f5a7c0d1b6d739a1ff8693d85a2.jpg","TNa4f8a3ec9e949dad37d084eab014ab0c495658a7.jpg","TN0599f1794055f27bf182b57d70fc54bd77100a5d.jpg","TN6ffef692255015335cfdc53149722922803e587a.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TNbkttampinfallfullweb.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TNscreenshot(879).png","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TNf7183ab4ade34f5a7c0d1b6d739a1ff8693d85a2.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TNa4f8a3ec9e949dad37d084eab014ab0c495658a7.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TN0599f1794055f27bf182b57d70fc54bd77100a5d.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/76BktTampin/tn/TN6ffef692255015335cfdc53149722922803e587a.jpg"],"imgDesc":["Bukit Tampin Fall","Image 1","Hill Trail","Tampin Cascade 1","Tampin Cascade 2","Old Catchment Dam"],"imgFullResFilename":["bkttampinfallfullweb.jpg","screenshot(877).png","0599f1794055f27bf182b57d70fc54bd77100a5d.jpg","screenshot(879).png","a4f8a3ec9e949dad37d084eab014ab0c495658a7.jpg","f7183ab4ade34f5a7c0d1b6d739a1ff8693d85a2.jpg","6ffef692255015335cfdc53149722922803e587a.jpg"]},"url":"76BktTampin.php"}
