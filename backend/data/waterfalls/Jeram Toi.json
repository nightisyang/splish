{"name":"Jeram Toi","description":"The Jeram Toi waterfalls are located about halfway between Seremban and Kuala Kelawang. They were discovered by the British in 1895 and became a popular place for a relaxing bath and a family picnic. Access is very easy from the Seremban-Kuala Kelawang road. In earlier days you just had to park beside the road, but at present this road is being upgraded to a four-lane highway. A special exit, clearly signposted, has been made to Jeram ToiThe park has shelters, toilets, barbeque pits, and a cemented walkway with steps leading up the gorge. The place might be crowded on weekends, but on a weekday it is quite desolate. That the entrance to the park is no longer off the main road, might explain the impression of deacy.The setting of the waterfalls is very romantic. The huge forest trees make this a cool place, even on a hot day. Altogether there are four major falls.After the last fall, you have reached the top of the gorge. If you like you can follow the trail further along the river.View of the valley deep downArchived page availableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
