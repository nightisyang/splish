{"name":"Tajor Fall","description":"Bako National Park, although small, is the oldest national park in Sarawak. It was gazetted as a protected area on 1st May 1957 and opened to public on 4th May 1957. It is located at the tip of the Muara Tebas Peninsula with an area of about 2727 hectares, 20 km North East from Kuching.Coming from Kuching, take Jalan Bako to the Bako Jetty. You have to register, pay the park entrance fee (RM10) & the boat fee (RM47/trip/boat or RM9/person/trip if there are 6 to 10 person). The boat ride to Bako National Park main office at Telok Asam takes about 20 minutes. Depending on the tide, you will land at a jetty, or you may have to walk along the beach. Don't forget to register at the park office.The Tajor trail is clearly signposted. After a wooden walkway through the Mangrove forest you enter the lowland jungle with a long stretch of shrubs and low vegetation. It is really hot here under the baking sun, take enough water with you!The length of the Tajor trail length is about 2.75 km, it will take 2 hours to reach the Tajor fall and the trail ends at Tajor Beach. The fall is not clearly visible from the trail, you have to trek upstream a bit. The Tajor Fall is small but attractive with a relaxing jungle scenery. The water has eroded a passageway under the rock, caused an \"overhanging ledge\" with the water freely flowing underneath the rock . There is a nice pool to dip and relax your tired limbs. Unlike many of the waterfall sites in Peninsular of Malaysia, the locals and visitors really do take care of the environment here. No human rubbish left. Try to keep it that way.","state":"Sarawak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N1° 43.38' E110° 28.25'","verbatimLatitude":"N1° 43.38'","verbatimLongitude":"E110° 28.25'","decimalLatitude":1.723,"decimalLongitude":110.47083,"decimalCoordinates":"1.723,110.47083"},"coordinates":"N1° 43.38'  E110° 28.25'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Horsetail","accessibility":"Boat trip and trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TN_A242243.jpg","TN_A242257.jpg","TN_A242268.jpg","TN_A242292.jpg","TN_A242318.jpg","TN_A242322.jpg","TN_A242329.jpg","TN_A242350.jpg","TN_A242352.jpg","TN_A242415.jpg","TN_A242354.jpg","TN_A242382.jpg","TN_A242384.jpg","TN_A242392.jpg","TN_A242387.jpg","TN_A242425.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242243.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242257.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242268.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242292.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242318.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242322.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242329.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242350.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242352.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242415.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242354.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242382.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242384.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242392.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242387.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/142tajor/tn/TN_A242425.jpg"],"imgDesc":["The Bako Jetty","Boat fares to the park attractions are clearly indicated","The speedboat bringing visitors to Bako N.P.","Scenery during the boat ride","During low tide you have to walk along the beach","Don’t forget to register upon arrival","A walkway has been built across the mangrove forest","Trekking here under the hot sun is no joke!","The trail is well marked","A small nameless fall on the way","Brownish water.
