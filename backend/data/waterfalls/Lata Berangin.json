{"name":"Lata Berangin","description":"Powerful Remote Fall in KelantanAt the end of the road you can park your car. From here the fall is already visible. It is a powerful one. At the bottom there is a big pool, where it is safe to bathe and swim. Even during the weekend it is not very crowded, because not many people know about this fall.It is not possible to climb up to the top of the waterfall. In dry weather you can climb the rocks until half way, after that it becomes too steep. Be very careful,locals told us that accidents have happened here!The interesting feature of this fall is that, although remote, it is easily accessible. Better go and visit this beautiful place, before it will be 'developed'.How beautiful nature can be!Check if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.

Lata Rek is clearly signposted, but for Lata Berangin you must know the way, as there is no signage at all. After visiting Lata Rek you continue on the road D227 for about 11 km where you turn right at a junction. After another 8 km you reach a bridge. Just after the bridge turn right into a very narrow tar road. This road ends after 1.5 km at the waterfall. ","\n\t","There are more falls in the region.
