{"name":"Lata Beringin Falls Series","description":"Lata Beringin Falls is a series of 6 waterfalls within close distance of each other. The main and 1st fall is Lata Beringin while the 6th fall is Jeram Air Mata Gajah. The falls here are not very tall but do feature a number of nice pools.Head to Hulu Langat as the landmark. Pass the Masjid Pekan Bt. 14 and proceed to Kg Sungai Semungkis. There is many junctions in Hulu Langat, the village access junction is signposted.(ref .) Proceed to follow the main road all the way straight till the end. There is an abandoned guard house but it is no longer gated.(ref ) Proceed on the dirt path to Lata Beringin campsite. The dirt road is quite flat and passable to sedan cars. Visitors will pass many river camp spots managed by private operators. Keep an eye out for the signboard that is near the destination.(ref )Image 1Image 2Image 3The Lata Beringin Falls campsite has a bamboo fencing and is managed by private operators. There is a parking and entrance fee charged to visit the falls.(ref  & 5) The campsite is well managed and includes surau & toilet facilities. The 1st fall is located just beside the bamboo camping spots with a wide but not very deep pool.Image 4The clear jungle trail starts from the left of the river going uphill.(ref ) Sections of the trail are prepared with ropes for easy hiking during wet seasons. The trail does not directly pass all the waterfalls on the way in. Visitors who wish to visit the numerous falls in between will have to take the trail junction down the slope and scramble back to the same trail to continue upriver. The trail ends at Jeram Air Mata Gajah, a 2-step cascade waterfall with a rock closely resembling an elephant head. There is a nice pool at this level as well.
