To reach the fall, you follow the signs for the Damai Bay resort. The waterfall is visible from the road. You can park your car and then it is only a short walk to the first tier of the fall.The waterfall consist of a few tiers. The lower ones are small, the main one is quite impressive. Impossible to take a picture of the whole fall.We did not see a way to climb to the top of the waterfall. The pool is rather shallow, but deep enough for a swim and a bath.",
