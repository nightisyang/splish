{"name":"Papan Fall","description":"The town of Papan, located south-west of Ipoh, was once a busy tin mining town in the Kinat valley. Now it is a scenic ghost town, famous for the memorial to Sybil Kathigasu, of WWII fame. When you follow the main street out of the town, you will find a sign for Hutan Lipur Papan. The road runs along a small river.The difference between a cascade and a fall is not always so easy. Here it would be fair to say that there are several nice cascades. Only local people know about the place. Very suitable for a weekend picnic.","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N04 32.15' E101 0.22'","verbatimLatitude":"N04 32.15'","verbatimLongitude":"E101 0.22'","decimalLatitude":4.53583,"decimalLongitude":101.00367,"decimalCoordinates":"4.53583,101.00367"},"coordinates":"N04 32.15'  E101 0.22'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Cascades","accessibility":"Beside the road","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_5823.jpg","TNIMG_5845.jpg","TNIMG_5841.jpg","TNIMG_5838.jpg","TNIMG_5843.jpg","TNIMG_5844.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5823.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5845.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5841.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5838.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5843.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/60papan/tn/TNIMG_5844.jpg"],"imgDesc":["Sybil Kathigasu Memorial","The road to the Papan Recreational park","A nice stream","Cascades or waterfall?","Waterfall or cascades?","Popular with the local youth"],"imgFullResFilename":["papan00.gif","IMG_5823.jpg","IMG_5843.jpg","IMG_5838.jpg","IMG_5841.jpg","IMG_5844.jpg","IMG_5845.jpg"]},"url":"60papan.php"}
