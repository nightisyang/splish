{"name":"Lata Berumbun","description":"This powerfull fall is located in the isolated region of Gunung Benom, about 13 km from Kg Sg Klau. The easiest way to reach this small kampung is via Raub. A few km north of Raub, on the road to Kuala Lipis, you will find signage to Kg Klau. For an alternative, shorter route, you can also turn right about 7 km north of Bentong.In Kg Sg Klau you will find sign boards to the fall. This road is not very well marked, you may have to ask for directions.From the place where you park the car, it is only a short walk to the falls.It is possible to climb up the slope at the right side of the main fall. You will pass another fall in a steep ravine. Then there is the last waterfall.The upper fall has a nice big pool.Warning: the road conditions can be quite unpredictable!Archived Page AvailableCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
