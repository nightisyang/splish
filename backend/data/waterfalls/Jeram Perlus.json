{"name":"Jeram Perlus","description":"Jeram Perlus, one among many falls in the Hulu Langat area, is probably the nicest for those of us who like our forests without trash or tourists. Because it is not yet well known and takes a 2-3 hour hike to reach, you are likely to have this spot to yourself. The trail starts at a small Orang Asli village on a side road of the road to the Gabai falls.The hike is long but moderate, with almost no steep climbs. The first time you go, get an orang asli guide from the small village since there are side tracks which could take you the wrong way. The trail starts on a motorcycle path used by orang asli when they go hunting. In parts of the jungle, the path is quite overgrown but always passable.The falls itself is about 15-20 meters in height with a nice pool at the bottom. The guide dived into a small cave and came up with fish for dinner.Leeches? Moderate number to many when it's wet.Text and pictures courtesy of Rani and Dick SandlerCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip.
