{"name":"Jeram Glami","description":"Jeram Glami is a short & wide 2-tier cascade fall. The top section features gentle cascades with small soaking pools that flows down to a larger pool. This river is still recovering from the devastating floods back in Dec 2021. Many sections of the river are piled up with log debris and there are landslides at sections of the riverbank causing water quality to be murky as well.Head to Titi town as the landmark and proceed to Pusat Penyelidikan Perikanan Air Tawar FRI. Heading from Kuala Klawang town the access junction is on the left before Titi(refer image 1). There is a bridge before the research institute. The trail is on the right before the bridge(refer image 2). Plenty of parking spots here as there is a wide road reserve.The clear jungle trail is about 1.6km and leads to the river. The rest of the way is river trekking on the shallow riverbed.Detailed photos of the falls. Nothing found upriver despite river trekking another 1.2km.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.~Thank you~","state":"Negeri Sembilan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"3.03782, 102.02635","verbatimLatitude":"3.03782","verbatimLongitude":"102.02635","decimalLatitude":3.03782,"decimalLongitude":102.02635,"decimalCoordinates":"3.03782,102.02635"},"coordinates":"3.03782, 102.02635","waterSource":"Sg.
