{"name":"Jeram Nerai Falls","description":"Jeram Nerai falls consist of 3 cascade falls each with decent size pools. It is accessible from a derelict recreational resort. Cooling and pristine waters flow down from steep hills through this quiet jungle.Head to Tampin as the landmark. Take the northern route that leads to Kuala Pilah & Gemas. At the traffic light junction of Masjid Kariah Kg. Repah, take the left junction heading to Kuala Pilah Route 9 (). Visitors coming from the north (Johol) will have to take a detour as there is a fully collapsed bridge (2.514384, 102.241474 - July 2022) that is not passable. Head to Kg Hulu Yu and approach from the south instead. Near Surau Kg. Bachang, there is a left junction going into the village.() Proceed along the tarred road to reach the recreational resort.()The recreational resort has seen better days. Buildings are empty and in poor state. Park without obstructing any path or building access. Visitors can hike up the hill to use the water pipe trail or skip into the river down below to take the river trail. By river trail, it would take less than 15mins to reach the 1st fall. The water pipe hill trail on the other end leads directly to the 3rd falls.()Image 1Image 2Image 3Photos of the falls upriver below. The area around the falls is still pristine and clean. Please KEEP it that WAY!Image 4Exploration Notes : Beyond fall 3, the trail gets very tough. Clustered wood debris and thick vines hinder access.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ","state":"Negeri Sembilan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"2.51059, 102.23215","verbatimLatitude":"2.51059","verbatimLongitude":"102.23215","decimalLatitude":2.51059,"decimalLongitude":102.23215,"decimalCoordinates":"2.51059,102.23215"},"coordinates":"2.51059, 102.23215 - 2.51120, 102.23135","waterSource":"Sg. ???, Natural Stream","waterfallProfile":"Multi-Level Falls, with Pool","accessibility":"Trekking, <1 hour","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNjeramneraiwidefinalweb.jpg","TNscreenshot(882).png","TNscreenshot(881).png","TN166acd2b95532fd4dab5e057290755bcf3f3728c.jpg","TNf1414f8608023cba4512bf31d3040ad1e7fd314d.jpg","TNda1967d48cba0f6592e4f7e37793b1e27436d87d.jpg","TN1b79718a9378c1b17df5ed654173c414bbe8b173.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TNjeramneraiwidefinalweb.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TNscreenshot(882).png","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TNscreenshot(881).png","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TN166acd2b95532fd4dab5e057290755bcf3f3728c.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TNf1414f8608023cba4512bf31d3040ad1e7fd314d.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TNda1967d48cba0f6592e4f7e37793b1e27436d87d.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/137JNerai/tn/TN1b79718a9378c1b17df5ed654173c414bbe8b173.jpg"],"imgDesc":["Jeram Nerai Fall 1","Image 1","Image 2","Image 3","Image 4","Jeram Nerai Fall 2","Jeram Nerai Fall 3"],"imgFullResFilename":["f1414f8608023cba4512bf31d3040ad1e7fd314d.jpg","screenshot(880).png","jeramneraiwidefinalweb.jpg","screenshot(882).png","screenshot(881).png","166acd2b95532fd4dab5e057290755bcf3f3728c.jpg","1b79718a9378c1b17df5ed654173c414bbe8b173.jpg","da1967d48cba0f6592e4f7e37793b1e27436d87d.jpg"]},"url":"137JNerai.php"}
