{"name":"Lubuk Kawah fall","description":"The Bernam river forms the boundary between Selangor and Perak. There are many tributaries, all originating from the main range around Gunung Semangkok. The Sg Lubuk Kawah is one of them, it flows into the Sg Perah, which in its turn feeds the Bernam river. Both rivers have waterfalls. Access would be difficult if not for the existence of minor roads along the Bernam river. One of these roads leads to the Teretak resort, where you can park your car. It is advisable to use a guide for the trek to the waterfalls. Contact us for more info.The first part of the trek follows a small road. The trail continues through bamboo forest and you have to cross a river. After about one hour you will reach a river crossing, where 4WD's can cross the Bernam river. It is one of the disadvantages of the Ulu Bernam region that it is a playground for 4WD's. Of course there are exceptions, but often they have little respect for nature. After trekking for one more hour you reach the confluence of the Perah and the Lubuk Kawah river, from where it is not far to the Lubuk Kawah fall.The Lubuk Kawah fall is a beautiful fall in a pristine location. Be careful when you take a bath here, the currents are strong. There is a nice, safe campsite, not far from the river. There should be more waterfalls upstream. You can river trek down to the confluence with the Perah river, where there is another waterfall. Take care, the rocks can be slippery!Sg Perah fallCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
