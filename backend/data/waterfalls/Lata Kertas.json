{"name":"Lata Kertas","description":"The D29 is a secondary road connecting Gua Musang with Dabong, crossing the mighty Nenggiri river. It gives access to the Stong fall, but about 20 km before you reach Dabong, there is another waterfall, only a few hundred meter from the road. In the past there must have been plans to develop this place, now only some ruins are left. The Lata Kertas is not a tall fall, but quite wide. You will not spend a long time here, but it is worth a visit, when you are in the region. Here is a short video of Lata Kertas:","state":"Kelantan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N5 14.60 E101 57.351","verbatimLatitude":"N5 14.60","verbatimLongitude":"E101 57.351","decimalLatitude":5.24333,"decimalLongitude":101.95585,"decimalCoordinates":"5.24333,101.95585"},"coordinates":"N5 14.60 E101 57.351","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical","accessibility":"Walk from car park","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_1728.JPG","TNIMG_1727.JPG","TNIMG_1715.JPG","TNPA030846.JPG","TNIMG_1713.JPG","TNIMG_1721.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNIMG_1728.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNIMG_1727.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNIMG_1715.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNPA030846.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNIMG_1713.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/169kertas/tn/TNIMG_1721.JPG"],"imgDesc":["A few hundred meters from the main road D29","Desolate and rundown ","The river is nice","Lata Kertas, not tall, but wide","View from the side","Detail"],"imgFullResFilename":["IMG_1721.JPG","map.JPG","IMG_1727.JPG","PA030846.JPG","IMG_1728.JPG","IMG_1715.JPG","IMG_1713.JPG"]},"url":"169kertas.php"}
