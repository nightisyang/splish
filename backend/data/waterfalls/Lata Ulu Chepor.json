{"name":"Lata Ulu Chepor","description":"To reach the recreational site of Ulu Chepor, follow the directions to Ipoh and Jelapang. From Jelapang take the road to Chemor. After about 4 km you reach Kg Ulu Chepor. Here you will find a signboard to the picnic area of Ulu Chenor. Follow the small road until your reach the site where you can park your car. On weekends there will be a few Ringgit fee.The site is well maintained with food stalls, some chalets, a surau, pondoks etc.The river has crystal clear water and is suitable for bathing. On weekdays you may be almost the only visitor, but on weekends it can get crowded. Where the tar road ends, a clear trail starts, following the river. You will pass several nice cascades and small falls. After less than 1 km you reach the first fall. Not a spectacular one, but with a nice pool.It is a perfect place to swim and enjoy the surrounding nature. The trail continues for another 500 meter, passing between two huge boulders, before it reaches a second fall","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N 04 42.58' E 101 4.12'","verbatimLatitude":"N 04 42.58'","verbatimLongitude":"E 101 4.12'","decimalLatitude":4.70967,"decimalLongitude":101.06867,"decimalCoordinates":"4.70967,101.06867"},"coordinates":"N 04 42.58' E 101 4.12'","waterSource":"River","waterfallProfile":"Cascades & small falls","accessibility":"From car park","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNIMG_0902.JPG","TNIMG_0842.JPG","TNIMG_0900.JPG","TNIMG_0901.JPG","TNIMG_0845.JPG","TNIMG_0843.JPG","TNIMG_0846.JPG","TNIMG_0850.JPG","TNIMG_0852.JPG","TNIMG_0891.JPG","TNIMG_0859.JPG","TNIMG_0853.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0902.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0842.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0900.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0901.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0845.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0843.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0846.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0850.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0852.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0891.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0859.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/153chepor/tn/TNIMG_0853.JPG"],"imgDesc":["Signboard to the picnic site","A map of the site","Food stalls near the car park","The chalets look a but rundown","There is a surau","And a playground for the kids","Many small cascades with clear water","Nice surroundings","The first waterfall","First fall side view ","You have to pass these huge boulders","The second fall"],"imgFullResFilename":["IMG_0845.JPG","IMG_0902.JPG","IMG_0842.JPG","IMG_0843.JPG","IMG_0852.JPG","IMG_0859.JPG","IMG_0900.JPG","chepormap.JPG","IMG_0846.JPG","IMG_0850.JPG","IMG_0901.JPG","IMG_0891.JPG","IMG_0853.JPG"]},"url":"153chepor.php"}
