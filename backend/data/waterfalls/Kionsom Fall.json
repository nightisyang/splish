{"name":"Kionsom Fall","description":"Kionsom Fall,located at Inanam, is the nearest waterfall to Kota Kinabalu City, about 25 kms or a 30-40 minutes drive from the town. The waterfall is famous among the locals and can be crowded especially during weekends & holidays. When you come from Kota Kinabalu city, just follow the directions to Inanam. In Inanam you take right at the roundabout to Jalan Kionsom. At the end of this road, just after the Mari Mari cultural village, you will find the waterfall park.The waterfall has four main tiers of different types. The first and second tier are easyly accessible by using a cemented path. The third fall is inaccessible. To go to the last tier, you have to scramble up the slope. Be careful of every step, the rocks and roots can be very slippery.The narrow path is clear unless some part is blocked by the fallen trunk. Other than that, it's easy to follow. When you see the fall from the slope, try to find a route to go down to the stream, there is an obvious route. Hold tight at the tree roots and scramble down the steep slope slowly. Following the narrow jungle trail further upstream, you will find some mini cascades and an abandoned hanging bridge.","state":"Sabah","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N5 58.32 E116 12.52","verbatimLatitude":"N5 58.32","verbatimLongitude":"E116 12.52","decimalLatitude":5.972,"decimalLongitude":116.20867,"decimalCoordinates":"5.972,116.20867"},"coordinates":"N5 58.32 E116 12.52","waterSource":"Sungai Kionsom","waterfallProfile":"Cascade & near vertical fall","accessibility":"Recreation Park","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNPB306681.jpg","TNPB306676.jpg","TNPB306675.jpg","TNPB306667.jpg","TNPB306669.jpg","TNPB306642.jpg","TNPB306644.jpg","TNPB306647.jpg","TNPB306660.jpg","TNPB306665.jpg","TNPB306664.jpg"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306681.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306676.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306675.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306667.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306669.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306642.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306644.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306647.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306660.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306665.jpg","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/151kionsom/tn/TNPB306664.jpg"],"imgDesc":["The signboard near the entrance to Mari-Mari cultural village.
