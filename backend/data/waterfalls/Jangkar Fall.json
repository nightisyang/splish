{"name":"Jangkar Fall","description":"The Jangkar fall is a powerful, remote fall, located on the slopes of the Berumput range, the boundary between Sarawak and Indonesia.From Kuching you first follow road nr 1. After crossing the Kayan river, you look for signs to Biawak. From the road you can see the waterfall already.At (N 01 38.82' E 109 43.00') a small road to the road leads to Kg Jantan, where you can park your car. Try to find a guide here.An easy trail leads first trough plantations until you reach the Jangkar river after about 45 minutes. Here the trail ends and you start trekking the river. Huge boulders make this a tough trek, only possible under good weather conditions. Don't try this trek when it has rained or might rain! Even with good weather, you must be careful. But it is also big fun. After another hour you reach the spectacular waterfall, with a huge deep pool. A nice place to relax, enjoy your lunch and take a bath. The slopes are steep, no trail, so we did not even try to climb to the top. It seems that there are more falls upstream!The upper part of Jangkar fallCheck if you need a permit before planning a waterfall trip. More information hereWaterfalls can be dangerous !
