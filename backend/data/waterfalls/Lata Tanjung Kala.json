{"name":"Lata Tanjung Kala","description":"Just south of Grik on the way to Kuala Kangsar, a small sign shows the way to Lata Tanjung Kala. The road passes through rural countryside and there are several junctions and forks. We had to ask around a few times, before we found the right road. There are almost no further signs. Park your car at the end of the road and start walking. The first part is along a farm road.After about 500 meter you cross a logging trail and from there you just follow the river bed. Hardly any trace of a trail. Not many visitors will come this far. Be prepared to meet an occassional wild boar, however.In total there are three waterfalls. This is a pristine area.Archived page available","state":"Perak","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"N05 26.61' E101 05.08'","verbatimLatitude":"N05 26.61'","verbatimLongitude":"E101 05.08'","decimalLatitude":5.4435,"decimalLongitude":101.08467,"decimalCoordinates":"5.4435,101.08467"},"coordinates":"N05 26.61'  E101 05.08'","waterSource":"Stream","waterfallProfile":"Near Vertical Falls","accessibility":"River trekking","imgDetails":{"imgFilename":["TNlatakala01.JPG","TNlatakala02.JPG","TNlatakala03.JPG","TNlatakala04.JPG","TNlatakala05.JPG","TNlatakala06.JPG","TNlatakala07.JPG","TNlatakala08.JPG","TNlatakala09.JPG"],"imgUrl":["http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala01.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala02.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala03.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala04.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala05.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala06.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala07.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala08.JPG","http://waterfallsofmalaysia.com/images/49latakala/tn/TNlatakala09.JPG"],"imgDesc":["This is about the only signboard you will come across.
