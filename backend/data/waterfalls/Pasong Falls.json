{"name":"Pasong Falls","description":"Pasong Falls is a series of 5 small cascade falls within close distance to each other. The 1st fall is visible from the road and is a common picnic/rest stop for visitors, hence there are quite a lot of rubbish around. The upper levels are quite technical to hike up due to the rocky terrain and visitors who make the effort will be rewarded with pristine surroundings and charming falls.Head to Simpang Pertang as the landmark. From Kuala Klawang the junction access is from Pertang(refer ) while from the south it is accessible via Batu Kikir Police Station t-junction(refer )The location of the roadside cascade is easy to miss. It is at 2°54'47.4\"N 102°13'49.1\"E (refer ) Plenty of parking space here by the side of the road.The hike to the upper levels of the falls is quite rocky and technical following the river, it should take no more than 15mins to reach the 5th fall. Visitors are advised to be careful to avoid unfortunate mishaps.Roadside falls like this are usually very vulnerable to irresponsible littering from visitors, make sure to keep a rubbish bag at hand!Image 1.Image 2.Image 3.Detailed images of the other falls of the series.\"Rubbish exist when there is an imbalance of those willing to take action.\"If you plan to visit this waterfall, do bring a plastic bag along. In the event there is rubbish left by irresponsible individuals, you can contribute and do our part to keep nature's paradise clean.Thank you~ ","state":"Negeri Sembilan","location":{"verbatimCoordinates":"2.91298, 102.23041","verbatimLatitude":"2.91298","verbatimLongitude":"102.23041","decimalLatitude":2.91298,"decimalLongitude":102.23041,"decimalCoordinates":"2.91298,102.23041"},"coordinates":"2.91298, 102.23041 (1st) ~ 2.91247, 102.23156 (5th)","waterSource":"Sg.
